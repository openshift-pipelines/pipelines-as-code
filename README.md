Pipelines-as-Code is an opinionated CI/CD solution for Tekton and OpenShift Pipelines that allows you to define and manage your pipelines directly from your source code repository.

## Overview

Pipelines-as-Code brings the [Pipelines-as-Code methodology](https://teamhub.com/blog/understanding-pipeline-as-code-in-software-development/) to Tekton. It provides a simple and declarative way to define your pipelines in your Git repository and have them automatically executed on your Kubernetes cluster. It integrates seamlessly with Git providers like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Gitea, and provides feedback directly on your pull requests and commits.

## Why Pipelines-as-Code?

Traditional CI/CD systems often require you to configure pipelines through web interfaces or separate configuration repositories. Pipelines-as-Code changes this by:

- **Version Control**: Your pipeline definitions live alongside your code, so they're versioned, reviewed, and evolved together
- **GitOps Native**: Perfect fit for GitOps workflows where everything is defined as code and managed through Git
- **Developer Experience**: Developers can modify pipelines using familiar Git workflows instead of learning separate CI/CD interfaces
- **Review Process**: Pipeline changes go through the same pull request review process as your application code
- **Branch-specific Pipelines**: Different branches can have different pipeline configurations for feature development
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Portable Tekton-based pipelines that work across any Kubernetes cluster

## How it Works

Pipelines-as-Code follows a simple event-driven workflow:

1. **Git Event**: A developer pushes code, opens a pull request, or creates a tag
2. **Event Detection**: Pipelines-as-Code receives the webhook from your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
3. **Repository Scan**: PAC looks for a `.tekton/` directory in your repository
4. **Pipeline Resolution**: Found pipeline definitions are processed and resolved (including remote tasks from Tekton Hub)
5. **Execution**: PipelineRuns are created and executed on your Kubernetes cluster
6. **Feedback**: Results are reported back to your Git provider as status checks, PR comments, or commit statuses

The system supports advanced features like:

- Conditional execution based on file changes
- CEL expression language support for event matching
- Template variable substitution (e.g. repo URL, commit SHA, branch name)
- Secret management for secure operations
- Authorization controls to restrict pipeline execution to authorized users (repo admins, members, etc.)
- Automatic cancellation of running PipelineRuns when new events occur
- Incoming webhooks for manual pipeline triggering
- Automatic cleanup of completed PipelineRuns

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Pipelines-as-Code, ensure you have:

- **Kubernetes cluster**: Version 1.27+ recommended
- **Tekton Pipelines**: Version 0.50.0+ (latest stable recommended)
- **Git Provider**: One of:
  - GitHub (GitHub App or Webhook)
  - GitLab (Webhook)
  - Gitea/Forgejo (Webhook)
  - Bitbucket Cloud/Data Center (Webhook)
- **CLI Tool**: `kubectl` for cluster access
- **Optional**: `tkn` CLI for Tekton operations

## Key Features

- **Git-based workflow**: Define your Tekton pipelines in your Git repository and have them automatically triggered on Git events like push, pull request, and comments.
- **Multi-provider support**: Works with GitHub (via GitHub App & Webhook), GitLab, Gitea, Bitbucket Data Center & Cloud via webhooks.
- **Annotation-driven workflows**: Target specific events, branches, or CEL expressions and gate untrusted PRs with `/ok-to-test` and `OWNERS`; see [Running the PipelineRun](https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/guide/running/).
- **ChatOps style control**: `/test`, `/retest`, `/cancel`, and branch or tag selectors let you rerun or stop PipelineRuns from PR comments or commit messages; see [GitOps Commands](https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/guide/gitops_commands/).
- **Feedback**: GitHub Checks capture per-task timing, log snippets, and optional error annotations while redacting secrets; see [PipelineRun status](https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/guide/statuses/).
- **Inline resolution**: The resolver bundles `.tekton/` resources, inlines remote tasks from Artifact Hub or Tekton Hub, and validates YAML before cluster submission; see [Resolver](https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/guide/resolver/).
- **CLI**: `tkn pac` bootstraps installs, manages Repository CRDs, inspects logs, and resolves runs locally; see the [CLI guide](https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/guide/cli/).
- **Automated housekeeping**: Keep namespaces tidy with the `pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/max-keep-runs` annotation or global settings, and automatically cancel running PipelineRuns when new commits are pushed to the same branch; see [PipelineRuns Cleanup](https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/guide/cleanups/) and [Cancel in progress](https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/guide/running/#cancelling-in-progress-pipelineruns).

## Quick Examples

Here's a simple example of a Tekton pipeline triggered by pull requests using Pipelines as Code:

```yaml
# .tekton/pull-request.yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: pr-build
  annotations:
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[pull_request]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: "[main]"
spec:
  pipelineSpec:
    tasks:
    - name: fetch-repository
      taskRef:
        name: git-clone
        resolver: hub
      workspaces:
      - name: output
        workspace: source
      params:
      - name: url
        value: "{{ repo_url }}"
      - name: revision
        value: "{{ revision }}"
    - name: run-tests
      runAfter: [fetch-repository]
      taskRef:
        name: golang-test
        resolver: hub
      workspaces:
      - name: source
        workspace: source
  workspaces:
  - name: source
    emptyDir: {}
```

Note: you can generate complete PipelineRun YAML using `tkn-pac` cli like below:

```console
$ tkn pac generate
? Enter the Git event type for triggering the pipeline:  Pull Request
? Enter the target GIT branch for the Pull Request (default: main):  main
ℹ Directory .tekton has been created.
✓ A basic template has been created in .tekton/pull-request.yaml, feel free to customize it.
ℹ You can test your pipeline by pushing the generated template to your git repository
```

This pipeline will automatically run on every pull request to the `main` branch, fetch the code, and run tests.
