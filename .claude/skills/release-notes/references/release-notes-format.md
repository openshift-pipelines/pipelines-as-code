# Release Notes Format Reference

## Entry Format

Each release note entry MUST follow this exact format. The Link and Jira lines MUST be indented with two spaces so they render as nested sub-bullets:

```markdown
* **Bold title:** One-sentence description of the change.
  * Link: <PR_OR_COMMIT_URL>
  * Jira: [SRVKP-XXXX](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SRVKP-XXXX)
```

### Rules

- The first bullet MUST start with `*` (no indent) with a bold title followed by a colon and a description.
- The Link line MUST start with `* Link:` (two-space indent) with the PR or commit URL.
- The Jira line MUST start with `* Jira:` (two-space indent). Include it ONLY if the entry has JIRA tickets. If there are multiple tickets, list each as a separate markdown link comma-separated.
- Within each section, list entries that have JIRA tickets FIRST, before entries without JIRA tickets.
- Do NOT add a Contributors section.
