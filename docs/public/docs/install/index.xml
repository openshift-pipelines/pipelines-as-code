      <description>Create a Pipelines-as-Code GitHub App #  The GitHub App install is different than other install methods since it acts as the integration point with OpenShift Pipelines and brings the Git workflow into Tekton pipelines. You only need one GitHub App for every users on the cluster usually setup by the admin.
You need the webhook of the GitHub App to point to your Pipelines-as-Code Controller route/ingress endpoint which would listen to GitHub events.</description>

      <description>Install Pipelines-as-Code as a GitHub Webhook #  If you are not able to create a GitHub application you can install Pipelines-as-Code on your repository as a GitHub Webhook.
Using Pipelines as Code via Github webhook does not give you access to the GitHub CheckRun API, therefore the status of the tasks will be added as a Comment of the PR and not via the Checks Tab.

  You will have to generate a personal token as the manager of the Org or the Project, follow the steps here :
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html
Note: You can create a token scoped only to the project. Since the token needs to be able to have api access to the forked repository from where the MR come from, it will fail to do it with a project scoped token.</description>
