# Pipelines-as-Code

An opinionated CI based on OpenShift Pipelines / Tekton.

## Introduction

Pipelines as code is a project allowing you to define your CI/CD using
[Tekton](https://tekton.dev) PipelineRuns and Tasks in a file located in your
source control management (SCM) system, such as GitHub or Gitlab. This file is
then used to automatically create a pipeline for a Pull Request or a Push to a
branch.

By storing the pipeline definition in code, it becomes easier to version,
review, and collaborate on pipeline changes with code changes. Additionally, it
allows you to view the pipeline status and control its execution directly from
your SCM, rather than having to switch between multiple systems.

This approach enables automation, repeatability, collaboration, and change
tracking using a Git workflow.

## Features

- Pull-request status support: When iterating over a Pull Request. Statuses and
  Control is done on GitHub.

- GitHub Checks API support to set the status of a PipelineRun including rechecks

- GitHub Pull Request and Push event support

<--->

- Pull-request "*GitOps*" actions through comments with  `/retest`, `/test <pipeline-name>` and so on.

- Automatic Task resolution in Pipelines (local Tasks, Tekton Hub, and remote URLs)

- Efficient use of GitHub blobs and objects API for retrieving configurations

<--->

- Git events Filtering and support for separate pipelines for each event

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to use the `tkn pac` CLI and its
[bootstrap](/docs/guide/cli/#commands) command. We recommend you to start
playing with Pipelines-as-Code with your personal [GitHub](https://github.com/)
user by installing Pipelines-as-Code on your laptop with
[Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) or [OpenShift
Local](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview) and
explore how it works before installing it on your own cluster.

- This [Guide]({{< relref "/docs/install/getting-started.md" >}}) will help you
  get started by creating a GitHub Application, configuring Pipelines-as-Code,
  and creating your first PipelineRun from a Pull Request.

  will guide you through the process.
