# Pipelines as Code

An opinionated CI based on OpenShift Pipelines / Tekton.

## Introduction

Pipelines as Code let you use
the [Pipelines as Code flow](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/pipelines-as-code)
directly with OpenShift Pipelines.

The goal of Pipelines as Code is to let you define your
[Tekton](https://tekton.dev) templates inside your source code repository and
have the pipeline run and report the status
of the execution when triggered by a `Pull Request` or a `Push`.

## Features

{{< columns >}} <!-- begin columns block -->

- Pull-request status support: When iterating over a Pull Request. Statuses and
  Control is done on GitHub.

- GitHub Checks API support to set the status of a PipelineRun including rechecks

- GitHub Pull Request and Push event support

<--->

- Pull-request "*GitOps*" actions through comments with  `/retest`, `/test <pipeline-name>` and so on.

- Automatic Task resolution in Pipelines (local Tasks, Tekton Hub, and remote URLs)

- Efficient use of GitHub blobs and objects API for retrieving configurations

<--->

- Git events Filtering and support for separate pipelines for each event

- Gitlab, Bitbucket Server, Bitbucket Cloud and GitHub Webhook support.

- `tkn-pac` plug-in for Tekton CLI for managing pipelines-as-code repositories and bootstrapping.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to use the `tkn pac` CLI and its [bootstrap](/docs/guide/cli/#commands) command.

Start downloading and install the tkn-pac CLI following [these instructions](/docs/guide/cli#install) and
while connected to your cluster (for example using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) for testing) run the command :

```bash
-$ tkn pac bootstrap
```

and follow the questions to get Pipelines as Code installed on your cluster.
It will then help you create a GitHub Application to connect your repositories to Pipelines as Code.
If you are in a source code project, it will immediately ask you if you want to have a sample `PipelineRun` for `Pipelines as Code`

## Documentation

For more details on the different installation methods please follow [the
installation document](/docs/install/overview) detailing the Pipelines as Code
installation steps.

If you need to use `Pipelines as Code` and author `PipelineRuns` you can follow
the [usage guide](/docs/guide)
