title: Incoming Webhook
weight: 4
---

This page explains how to configure and use incoming webhooks to trigger PipelineRuns via HTTP requests. Use incoming webhooks when you need to start a pipeline from an external system -- such as a CI orchestrator, a cron job, or a deployment script -- without pushing a new commit to the repository.

## Overview

Pipelines-as-Code supports incoming webhook URLs. Instead of requiring a new code change to trigger a pipeline, you can send an HTTP POST request with a shared secret to start a PipelineRun directly. This is useful for triggering pipelines from tools like `curl`, web services, or automation platforms.

## Incoming Webhook URL

To use incoming webhooks, configure the
`incoming` field in your Repository CR. This field references a `Secret` that
serves as the shared secret, and specifies the branches targeted by the incoming
webhook. Once configured, Pipelines-as-Code matches PipelineRuns located in
your `.tekton/` directory whose `on-event` annotation targets a push or incoming event.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
If you are not using the GitHub App provider (that is, you use a webhook-based provider), include a `git_provider` spec to specify a token.

Because Pipelines-as-Code cannot automatically detect the provider type
from the URL, you must also set the `git_provider.type` field. Supported
values are:

- github
- gitlab
- forgejo
- gitea (alias for forgejo)
- bitbucket-cloud
- bitbucket-datacenter

For `github-apps`, this is not required.

### Required Parameters

Whether you use the recommended POST request body or the deprecated query parameter method,
the `/incoming` endpoint accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter   | Type   | Description                                                                          | Required                                          |
|-------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|`repository` |`string`| Name of Repository CR                                                                | `true`                                            |
|`namespace`  |`string`| Namespace with the Repository CR                                                     | When Repository name is not unique in the cluster |
|`branch`     |`string`| Branch configured for incoming webhook                                               | `true`                                            |
|`pipelinerun`|`string`| Name (or generateName) of PipelineRun, used to match PipelineRun definition          | `true`                                            |
|`secret`     |`string`| Secret key referenced by the Repository CR in desired incoming webhook configuration | `true`                                            |
|`params`     |`json`  | Parameters to override in PipelineRun context                                        | `false`                                           |

### GitHub App

The following example shows how to trigger a PipelineRun
through an incoming webhook URL when using the GitHub App provider.

The Repository CR targets the `main` branch and references a shared password stored in a
Secret called `repo-incoming-secret`:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: repo
  namespace: ns
spec:
  url: "https://github.com/owner/repo"
  incoming:
    - targets:
        - main
      secret:
        name: repo-incoming-secret
      type: webhook-url
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
If no secret key is specified in the Repository CR, the default key `secret` is used to retrieve the secret value from the `repo-incoming-secret` Secret resource.
{{< /callout >}}

### Glob Pattern Matching in Targets

The `targets` field supports both exact string matching and glob patterns, allowing you to match multiple branches with a single rule.

**Glob patterns:** Use shell-style patterns:

- `*` - matches any characters (e.g., `feature/*` matches `feature/login`, `feature/api`)
- `?` - matches exactly one character (e.g., `v?` matches `v1`, `v2`)
- `[abc]` - matches one character from set (e.g., `[A-Z]*` matches any uppercase letter)
- `[0-9]` - matches digits (e.g., `v[0-9]*.[0-9]*` matches `v1.2`, `v10.5`)
- `{a,b,c}` - matches alternatives (e.g., `{dev,staging}/*` matches `dev/test` or `staging/test`)

**First-match-wins:** If multiple incoming webhooks match the same branch, the first matching webhook in the YAML order is used. Place more specific webhooks before general catch-all webhooks.

#### Examples

**Match feature branches with glob:**

```yaml
apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: repo
  namespace: ns
spec:
  url: "https://github.com/owner/repo"
  incoming:
    - targets:
        - "feature/*"  # Matches any branch starting with "feature/"
      secret:
        name: feature-webhook-secret
      type: webhook-url
```

**Multiple webhooks with first-match-wins:**

```yaml
apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: repo
  namespace: ns
spec:
  url: "https://github.com/owner/repo"
  incoming:
    # Production - checked first (most specific)
    - targets:
        - main
        - "v[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*"  # Semver tags like v1.2.3
      secret:
        name: prod-webhook-secret
      params:
        - prod_env
      type: webhook-url

    # Feature branches - checked second
    - targets:
        - "feature/*"
        - "bugfix/*"
      secret:
        name: feature-webhook-secret
      params:
        - dev_env
      type: webhook-url

    # Catch-all - checked last
    - targets:
        - "*"  # Matches any branch not caught above
      secret:
        name: default-webhook-secret
      type: webhook-url
```

**Mix exact matches and glob patterns:**

```yaml
incoming:
  - targets:
      - main                            # Exact match
      - staging                         # Exact match
      - "release/v[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*" # Semver releases
      - "hotfix/[A-Z]*-[0-9]*"          # JIRA tickets (e.g., JIRA-123, PROJ-456)
      - "{dev,test,qa}/*"               # Alternation pattern
    secret:
      name: repo-incoming-secret
    type: webhook-url
```

**Glob Pattern Syntax:**

- `*` - matches any characters (zero or more)
- `?` - matches exactly one character
- `[abc]` - matches one character: a, b, or c
- `[a-z]` - matches one character in range a to z
- `[0-9]` - matches one digit
- `{a,b,c}` - matches any of the alternatives (alternation)

**Best Practices:**

- Place production/sensitive webhooks first in the list
- Use exact matches for known branches when possible (faster than glob patterns)
- Use character classes `[0-9]`, `[A-Z]` for more precise matching
- Glob patterns match the entire branch name (no partial matches unless you use `*` prefix/suffix)
- Test your patterns: branch `feature-login` matches `feature-*` but not `*feature*`
- [Test your glob patterns online](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tools/glob) before deploying to ensure they match only intended branches

### Using incoming webhooks

To receive incoming webhook triggers, annotate your PipelineRun to target the incoming event and the desired branch:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: target-pipelinerun
  annotations:
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[incoming]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: "[main]"
```

Next, create a secret called `repo-incoming-secret` that serves as the shared password. This ensures
that only authorized callers can trigger the PipelineRun:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: repo-incoming-secret
  namespace: ns
type: Opaque
stringData:
  secret: very-secure-shared-secret
```

After setting this up, trigger the PipelineRun by sending a POST
request to the controller URL appended with `/incoming`. Include the
shared secret (`very-secure-shared-secret`), the repository name (`repo`), the
target branch (`main`), and the PipelineRun name. You can pass these values either in the POST JSON body (recommended) or as URL query parameters (deprecated).

You can use the `generateName` field as the PipelineRun name, but make sure to include the trailing hyphen (`-`).

#### Legacy (URL query) method (deprecated)

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://control.pac.url/incoming?secret=very-secure-shared-secret&repository=repo&branch=main&pipelinerun=target-pipelinerun'
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Deprecated**: Passing secrets in the URL is insecure because query parameters appear in server logs and browser history. This method will be removed in a future release. Use the POST body method below instead.
{{< /callout >}}

#### Recommended (POST JSON body) method

```shell
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST "https://control.pac.url/incoming" -d '{"repository":"repo","branch":"main","pipelinerun":"target-pipelinerun","secret":"very-secure-shared-secret"}'
```

In both cases, the `"/incoming"` path and the `"POST"` method remain the same.

When you trigger a PipelineRun this way, Pipelines-as-Code treats it as a push event and reports the
status accordingly. To receive notifications, you can add a `finally` task
to your Pipeline or inspect the Repository CR
using the `tkn pac` CLI. See the [statuses]({{< relref "/docs/guides/statuses" >}}) documentation
for details.

### Passing dynamic parameter values to incoming webhooks

You can override any Pipelines-as-Code parameter, including
[built-in variables]({{< relref "/docs/guides/creating-pipelines#dynamic-variables" >}}), through the incoming webhook request.

To do this, list the parameter names in the `params` section of the
Repository CR and pass their values in the JSON body of the incoming webhook
request. Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.

The following Repository CR allows passing the `pull_request_number` dynamic variable:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: repo
  namespace: ns
spec:
  url: "https://github.com/owner/repo"
  incoming:
    - targets:
        - main
      params:
        - pull_request_number
      secret:
        name: repo-incoming-secret
      type: webhook-url
```

Here is a `curl` command that passes the `pull_request_number` value:

```shell
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST "https://control.pac.url/incoming" -d '{"repository":"repo","branch":"main","pipelinerun":"target-pipelinerun","secret":"very-secure-shared-secret","params": {"pull_request_number": "12345"}}'
```

Pipelines-as-Code sets the `pull_request_number` parameter to `12345`, so any use of
`{{pull_request_number}}` in your PipelineRun resolves to that value.

### Using incoming webhooks with GitHub Enterprise

When using a GitHub App with GitHub Enterprise, you must include the `X-GitHub-Enterprise-Host` header in the incoming webhook
request. For example:

```shell
curl -H "X-GitHub-Enterprise-Host: github.example.com" -X POST "https://control.pac.url/incoming?repository=repo&branch=main&secret=very-secure-shared-secret&pipelinerun=target-pipelinerun"
```

### Using incoming webhooks with webhook-based providers

Webhook-based providers (GitHub Webhook, GitLab, Bitbucket, and others) also support
incoming webhooks, authenticating with the token from the `git_provider` section.

The following example shows a Repository CR that targets the `main` branch using a GitHub webhook provider:

```yaml
apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: repo
  namespace: ns
spec:
  url: "https://github.com/owner/repo"
  git_provider:
    type: github
    secret:
      name: "owner-token"
  incoming:
    - targets:
        - main
      secret:
        name: repo-incoming-secret
      type: webhook-url
```

As described above, you must also create the `repo-incoming-secret` Secret containing the shared password.
