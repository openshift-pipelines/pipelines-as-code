# Status

## GitHub apps

After the `PipelineRun` has finished, its status will be
shown in the GitHub Check tabs, along with a concise overview
of the status the name and the duration of each task in the pipeline. If the task has a
[displayName](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/tasks/#specifying-a-display-name)
it will use it as the description of the task or otherwise just the task
name.

If any step fails, a small portion of the log from that step will
also be included in the output.

In case an error is encountered while creating the `PipelineRun` on the cluster,
the error message reported by the Pipeline Controller will be conveyed to the
GitHub user interface. This facilitates the user to swiftly identify and
troubleshoot the issue, without having to navigate to the underlying
infrastructure.

Any other error that may arise during the execution of the pipeline will also
be reported to the GitHub user interface. However, if there was no match for the
namespace, the error will be logged in the Pipelines-as-Code Controller's logs.

## Statuses for other providers (Webhook based)

If the webhook event pertains to a pull request, it will be included as a
comment to the corresponding pull or merge request. However, when it comes to
push events, it is not feasible to exhibit the status of the PipelineRun as
there is no dedicated space to showcase it. In such scenarios, you can employ
alternate methods as enumerated below.

## Log Snippet when reporting error

If an error is detected in one of the tasks in the Pipeline, a brief excerpt of
the last three lines from the task breakdown is displayed. However, the API has
a character limit that restricts us to output only the output of the first
failed task.

To prevent exposing secrets, Pipelines-as-Code analyze the PipelineRun and
replace secret values with hidden characters. This is achieved by retrieving
all secrets from the environment variables associated with tasks and steps, and
searching for matches of these values in the output snippet. These matches are
then replaced with a `"*****"` placeholder hiding these secrets.

The hiding of the secret does not support concealing secrets from `workspaces`
and
[envFrom](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#envfromsource-v1-core)
sources.

### Error detection from containers logs as GitHub Annotation

If you enable the `error-detection-from-container-logs` option in the
pipeline-as-code configuration map, Pipelines-as-Code will attempt to detect
errors from the container logs and add them as annotations on the corresponding
Pull Request where the error occurred.

Currently, only a simple error format such as those resembling `makefile` or
`grep` output are supported, specifically the format of :

```console
filename:line:column: error message
```

Tools like `golangci-lint`, `pylint`, `yamllint`, and many others can
produce errors in this format.

You can refer to the Pipelines-as-Code
[pull_request.yaml](https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/blob/7c9b16409a1a6c93e9480758f069f881e5a50f05/.tekton/pull-request.yaml#L70)
for an example of how we lint our code and output errors in the
specified format.

You can customize the regular expression used for detecting errors with the
`error-detection-simple-regexp` setting. The regular expression uses [named
groups](https://www.regular-expressions.info/named.html) to provide flexibility
in specifying the matching criteria. The necessary groups for matching are
filename, line, and error (the column group is not used). The default regular
expression is defined in the configuration map.

By default, Pipelines-as-Code searches for errors in only the last 50 lines of
the container logs. However, you can increase this limit by setting the
`error-detection-max-number-of-lines` value. If you set this value to -1, the
system will search through all available lines for errors. Keep in mind that
increasing this maximum number of lines may increase the memory usage of the
watcher.

## Namespace Event stream

When a namespace has been matched to a repository, Pipelines-as-Code will emit
its log messages as Kubernetes events within the namespace of the corresponding
repository.

## Repository CRD

The most recent five statuses of any PipelineRuns associated with a repository
are stored within the corresponding repository custom resource (CR).

```console
% kubectl get repo -n pipelines-as-code-ci
NAME                  URL                                                        NAMESPACE             SUCCEEDED   REASON      STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
pipelines-as-code-ci   https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code   pipelines-as-code-ci   True        Succeeded   59m         56m
```

Using the tkn pac describe command from the [cli](../cli/) you can easily view
all of the statuses of the PipelineRuns associated with your repository, as
well as their metadata.

## Notifications

Notifications are not managed by Pipelines-as-Code.

To add notifications to your pipeline runs, you can use the [finally feature of
Tekton
Pipelines](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/pipelines.md#adding-finally-to-the-pipeline).
This allows you to execute a set of tasks at the end of a
pipeline run, regardless of whether it succeeds or fails.

Here is an example of a task sending a [Slack](https://slack.com) message on failures or successes:

<https://github.com/chmouel/tekton-slack-task-status>

As an example, you can refer to the push pipeline in the Pipelines-as-Code
repository, which sends a Slack message if there are any failures while
generating artifacts on every push. The relevant section of the pipeline can be
found here:

<https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/blob/7b41cc3f769af40a84b7ead41c6f037637e95070/.tekton/push.yaml#L116>
