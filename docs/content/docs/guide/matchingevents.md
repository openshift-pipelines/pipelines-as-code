# Matching a PipelineRun to a Git provider Event

A `PipelineRun` can be matched to a Git provider event by using specific
annotations in the `PipelineRun` metadata.

For example, when you have these as metadata in your `PipelineRun`:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: pipeline-pr-main
annotations:
  pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: "[main]"
  pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[pull_request]"
```

`Pipelines-as-Code` will match the PipelineRun `pipeline-pr-main` if the Git
provider events target the branch `main` and it's coming from a `[pull_request]`

Multiple target branches can be specified, separated by commas, e.g.:

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: [main, release-nightly]
```

You can match on `pull_request` events as above, and you can also match
PipelineRuns on `push` events to a repository.

For example, this will match the pipeline when there is a push to a commit in the
`main` branch:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: pipeline-push-on-main
  annotations:
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: "[refs/heads/main]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[push]"
```

You can specify the full refs like `refs/heads/main` or the short ref like
`main`. You can also specify globs, for example, `refs/heads/*` will match any
target branch or `refs/tags/1.*` will match all the tags starting from `1.`.

A full example for a push of a tag:

```yaml
metadata:
name: pipeline-push-on-1.0-tags
annotations:
  pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: "[refs/tags/1.0]"
  pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[push]"
```

This will match the pipeline `pipeline-push-on-1.0-tags` when you push the 1.0
tags into your repository.

Matching annotations are currently required; otherwise, `Pipelines-as-Code` will not
match your `PipelineRun`.

When multiple PipelineRuns match an event, it will run them in parallel
and post the results to the provider as soon as the PipelineRun finishes.

{{< hint info >}}

* Payload matching happens only for events supported by `Pipelines-as-Code`,
such as when a `Pull Request` is opened, updated, or when a branch receives a
`Push`.

* Typically, you need both `on-target-branch` and `on-event` annotations to
match, except when using [CEL expressions](#advanced-event-matching-using-cel)
or [matching based on a
comment](#matching-a-pipelinerun-on-a-regex-in-a-comment).
{{< /hint >}}

## Matching a PipelineRun to Specific Path Changes

{{< tech_preview "Matching a PipelineRun to specific path changes via annotation" >}}

To trigger a `PipelineRun` based on specific path changes in an event, use the
annotation `pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-path-change`.

Multiple paths can be specified, separated by commas. The first glob matching
the files changes in the PR will trigger the `PipelineRun`. If you want to match
a file or path that has a comma, you can HTML escape it with the `&#44;` HTML
entity.

You still need to specify the event type and target branch. If you have a [CEL
expression](#matching-pipelinerun-by-path-change) the `on-path-change`
annotation will be ignored.

Example:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: pipeline-docs-and-manual
  annotations:
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: "[main]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[pull_request]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-path-change: "[docs/**.md, manual/**.rst]"
```

This configuration will match and trigger the `PipelineRun` named
`pipeline-docs-and-manual` when a `pull_request` event targets the `main` branch
and includes changes to files with a `.md` suffix in the `docs` directory (and
its subdirectories) or files with a `.rst` suffix in the `manual` directory.

{{< hint info >}}
The patterns used are [glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming))
patterns, not regex. Here are some
[examples](https://github.com/gobwas/glob?tab=readme-ov-file#example) from the
library used for matching.

The `tkn pac` CLI provides a handy [globbing command]({{< relref "/docs/guide/cli.md#test-globbing-pattern" >}})
to test the glob pattern matching:

```bash
tkn pac info globbing "[PATTERN]"
```

will match the files with `[PATTERN]` in the current directory.

{{< /hint >}}

### Matching a PipelineRun by Ignoring Specific Path Changes

{{< tech_preview "Matching a PipelineRun to ignore specific path changes via annotation" >}}

Following the same principle as the `on-path-change` annotation, you can use the
reverse annotation `pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-path-change-ignore` to trigger
a `PipelineRun` when the specified paths have not changed.

You still need to specify the event type and target branch. If you have a [CEL
expression](#matching-pipelinerun-by-path-change) the `on-path-change-ignore`
annotation will be ignored.

This PipelineRun will run when there are changes outside the docs
folder:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: pipeline-not-on-docs-change
  annotations:
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: "[main]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[pull_request]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-path-change-ignore: "[docs/***]"
```

Furthermore, you can combine `on-path-change` and `on-path-change-ignore`
annotations:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: pipeline-docs-not-generated
  annotations:
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: "[main]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[pull_request]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-path-change: "[docs/***]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-path-change-ignore: "[docs/generated/***]"
```

This configuration triggers the `PipelineRun` when there are changes in the
`docs` directory but not in the `docs/generated` directory.

The `on-path-change-ignore` annotation will always take precedence over the
`on-path-change` annotation. It means if you have these annotations:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: pipelinerun-go-only-no-markdown-or-yaml
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: "[main]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[pull_request]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-path-change: "[***.go]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-path-change-ignore: "[***.md, ***.yaml]"
```

and you have a `Pull Request` changing the files `.tekton/pipelinerun.yaml`,
`README.md`, and `main.go` the `PipelineRun` will not be triggered since the
`on-path-change-ignore` annotation will ignore the `***.md` and `***.yaml`
files.

## Matching a PipelineRun on a Regex in a comment

{{< tech_preview "Matching PipelineRun on regex in comments" >}}
{{< support_matrix github_app="true" github_webhook="true" gitea="true" gitlab="true" bitbucket_cloud="false" bitbucket_datacenter="false" >}}

You can trigger a PipelineRun based on a comment on a Pull Request or a [Pushed
Commit]({{< relref
"/docs/guide/running.md#gitops-commands-on-pushed-commits">}}) using the
annotation `pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-comment`.

The comment is treated as a regular expression (regex). The spaces and newlines
are stripped at the beginning or the end of the comment before matching so `^`
will match the beginning of the comment and `$` will match the end of the
comment without newlines or space.

If a new comment on a Pull Request matches the specified regex, the PipelineRun
will be triggered and started. This only applies to newly created comments;
updates or edits to existing comments will not trigger the PipelineRun.

Example:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: "merge-pr"
  annotations:
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-comment: "^/merge-pr"
```

This will trigger the merge-pr PipelineRun when a comment on a pull request
starts with `/merge-pr`.

When a PipelineRun is getting triggered by the `on-comment` annotation starts,
the template variable {{ trigger_comment }} is set. For more details, refer to
the [documentation]({{< relref
"/docs/guide/gitops_commands.md#accessing-the-comment-triggering-the-pipelinerun"
>}}).

Note that the on-comment annotation adheres to the pull_request [Policy]({{<
relref "/docs/guide/policy" >}}) rule. Only users specified in the pull_request
policy will be able to trigger the PipelineRun.

{{< hint info >}}
The on-comment annotation is supported for pull_request events. For push events,
it is only supported [when targeting the main branch without arguments]({{<
relref "/docs/guide/gitops_commands.md#gitops-commands-on-pushed-commits" >}}).
{{< /hint >}}

## Matching PipelineRun to a Pull Request labels

{{< tech_preview "Matching PipelineRun to a Pull-Request label" >}}
{{< support_matrix github_app="true" github_webhook="true" gitea="true" gitlab="true" bitbucket_cloud="false" bitbucket_datacenter="false" >}}

Using the annotation `pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-label`, you can match a
PipelineRun to a Pull Request label. For example, if you want to match the
PipelineRun `bugs` whenever a Pull Request has the label `bug` or `defect`, you
can use this annotation:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: match-bugs-or-defect
  annotations:
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-label: "[bug, defect]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: "[main]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[pull_request]"
```

* The `on-label` annotation respects the `pull_request` [Policy]({{< relref
  "/docs/guide/policy" >}}) rules.
* The `on-target-branch` is still needed to match the Pull Request event on the
  targeted branch.
* The `on-event` is still needed to match the Pull Request event on the
  proper targeted event.
* This annotation is currently supported only on GitHub, Gitea, and GitLab
  providers. Bitbucket Cloud and Bitbucket Data Center do not support adding labels
  to Pull Requests.
* When you add a label to a Pull Request, the corresponding PipelineRun is
  triggered immediately, and no other PipelineRun matching the same Pull Request
  will be activated.
* If you update the Pull Request by sending a new commit, the PipelineRun
  with a matching `on-label` annotation will be triggered again if the label is
  still present.
* You can access the `Pull Request` labels with the [dynamic variable]({{<
  relref "/docs/guide/authoringprs#dynamic-variables" >}}) `{{ pull_request_labels }}`.
  The labels are separated by a Unix newline `\n`.
  For example, with a shell script, you can do this to print them:

  ```bash
   for i in $(echo -e "{{ pull_request_labels }}");do
   echo $i
   done
  ```

## Advanced event matching using CEL

If you need to do some advanced matching, `Pipelines-as-Code` supports CEL
expressions to do advanced filtering on the specific event you need to be matched.

If you have the `pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-cel-expression` annotation in
your PipelineRun, the CEL expression will be used and the `on-target-branch` or
`on-event` annotations will be skipped.

This example will match a `pull_request` event targeting the branch `main`
coming from a branch called `wip`:

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-cel-expression: |
  event == "pull_request" && target_branch == "main" && source_branch == "wip"
```

The fields available are:

| **Field**         | **Description**                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `event`           | `push`, `pull_request` or `incoming`.                                                                                            |
| `target_branch`   | The branch we are targeting.                                                                                                     |
| `source_branch`   | The branch where this pull_request comes from. (On `push`, this is the same as `target_branch`.)                                 |
| `target_url`      | The URL of the repository we are targeting.                                                                                      |
| `source_url`      | The URL of the repository where this pull_request comes from. (On `push`, this is the same as `target_url`.)                     |
| `event_title`     | Matches the title of the event. For `push`, it matches the commit title. For PR, it matches the Pull/Merge Request title. (Only supported for `GitHub`, `GitLab`, and `BitbucketCloud` providers.) |
| `body`            | The full body as passed by the Git provider. Example: `body.pull_request.number` retrieves the pull request number on GitHub.    |
| `headers`         | The full set of headers as passed by the Git provider. Example: `headers['x-github-event']` retrieves the event type on GitHub.  |
| `.pathChanged`    | A suffix function to a string that can be a glob of a path to check if changed. (Supported only for `GitHub` and `GitLab` providers.) |
| `files`           | The list of files that changed in the event (`all`, `added`, `deleted`, `modified`, and `renamed`). Example: `files.all` or `files.deleted`. For pull requests, every file belonging to the pull request will be listed. |

CEL expressions let you do more complex filtering compared to the simple `on-target` annotation matching and enable more advanced scenarios.

For example, if I want to have a `PipelineRun` targeting a `pull_request` but
not the `experimental` branch you could have:

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-cel-expression: |
  event == "pull_request" && target_branch != experimental"
```

{{< hint info >}}
You can find more information about the CEL language spec here:

<https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md>
{{< /hint >}}

### Matching a PipelineRun to a branch with a regex

In a CEL expression, you can match a field name using a regular expression. For
example, if you want to trigger a `PipelineRun` for the`pull_request` event and
the `source_branch` name containing the substring `feat/`.  you can use the
following expression:

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-cel-expression: |
  event == "pull_request" && source_branch.matches(".*feat/.*")
```

### Matching PipelineRun by path change

> *NOTE*: `Pipelines-as-Code` supports two ways to match files changed in a particular event. The `.pathChanged` suffix function supports [glob
pattern](https://github.com/gobwas/glob#example) and does not support different types of "changes" i.e. added, modified, deleted and so on. The other option is to use the `files.` property (`files.all`, `files.added`, `files.deleted`, `files.modified`, `files.renamed`) which can target specific types of changed files and supports using CEL expressions i.e. `files.all.exists(x, x.matches('renamed.go'))`.

If you want to have a PipelineRun running only if a path has
changed you can use the `.pathChanged` suffix function with a [glob
pattern](https://github.com/gobwas/glob#example). Here
is a concrete example matching every markdown file (as files that have the `.md`
suffix) in the `docs` directory:

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-cel-expression: |
  event == "pull_request" && "docs/*.md".pathChanged()
```

This example will match any changed file (added, modified, removed, or renamed) that was in the `tmp` directory:

```yaml
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-cel-expression: |
      files.all.exists(x, x.matches('tmp/'))
```

This example will match any added file that was in the `src` or `pkg` directory:

```yaml
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-cel-expression: |
      files.added.exists(x, x.matches('src/|pkg/'))
```

This example will match modified files with the name of test.go:

```yaml
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-cel-expression: |
      files.modified.exists(x, x.matches('test.go'))
```

### Matching PipelineRun to an event (commit, pull_request) title

This example will match all pull requests starting with the title `[DOWNSTREAM]`:

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-cel-expression: |
  event == "pull_request && event_title.startsWith("[DOWNSTREAM]")
```

The event title will be the pull request title on `pull_request` and the
commit title on `push`.

### Matching PipelineRun on body payload

{{< tech_preview "Matching PipelineRun on body payload" >}}

The payload body as passed by the Git provider is available in the CEL
variable as `body` and you can use this expression to do any filtering on
anything the Git provider is sending over:

For example, this expression when run on GitHub:

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-cel-expression: |
  body.pull_request.base.ref == "main" &&
    body.pull_request.user.login == "superuser" &&
    body.action == "synchronize"
```

will only match if the pull request is targeting the `main` branch, the author
of the pull request is called `superuser` and the action is `synchronize` (i.e.:
an update occurred on a pull request).

{{< hint info >}}
When matching the body payload in a Pull Request, the GitOps comments such as
`/retest` won't be working as expected.

The payload body will become of the comment and not the original pull request
payload.

Consequently, when a pull request event occurs, like opening or updating a pull
request, the CEL body payload may not align with the defined specifications.

To be able to retest your Pull Request when using a CEL on body payload,
you can make a dummy update to the Pull Request by sending a new SHA with this
git command:

```bash
# assuming you are on the branch you want to retest
# and the upstream remote are set
git commit --amend --no-edit && \
  git push --force-with-lease
```

or close/open the pull request.

{{< /hint >}}

### Matching a PipelineRun to a request header

You can do some further filtering on the headers as passed by the Git provider
with the CEL variable `headers`.

The headers are available as a list and are always in lower case.

For example, this is how to make sure the event is a pull_request on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#delivery-headers):

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-cel-expression: |
  headers['x-github-event'] == "pull_request"
```

## Matching a PipelineRun to a branch with a comma

If you want to match multiple branches but one branch has a comma in there you
will not be able to match it. In that case, you can use the HTML escape entity
`&#44;` as a comma in the name of the branch, for example, if you want to match
main and the branch called `release,nightly` you can do this:

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: [main, release&#44;nightly]
```
