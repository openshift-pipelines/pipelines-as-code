# GitOps Commands

Pipelines-as-Code supports the concept of `GitOps commands`, which allow users to issue special commands in a comment on a Pull Request or a pushed commit to control `Pipelines-as-Code`.

The advantage of using a `GitOps command` is that it provides a journal of all the executions of your pipeline directly on your Pull Request, near your code.

## GitOps Commands on Pull Requests

For example, when you are on a Pull Request, you may want to restart failed PipelineRuns. To do so, you can add a comment on your Pull Request starting with `/retest`, and all **failed** PipelineRuns attached to that Pull Request will be restarted. If all previous PipelineRuns for the same commit were successful, no new PipelineRuns will be created to avoid unnecessary duplication.

Example:

```text
Thanks for contributing. This is a much-needed bugfix, and we appreciate it ❤️ The
failure is not with your PR but seems to be an infrastructure issue.

/retest
```

The `/retest` command will only create new PipelineRuns if:

- Previously **failed** PipelineRuns for the same commit, OR
- No PipelineRun has been run for the same commit yet

If a successful PipelineRun already exists for the same commit, `/retest` will **skip** triggering a new PipelineRun to avoid unnecessary duplication.

**To force a rerun regardless of previous status**, use:

```text
/retest <pipelinerun-name>
```

This will always trigger a new PipelineRun, even if previous runs were successful.

Similar to `/retest`, the `/ok-to-test` command will only trigger new PipelineRuns if no successful PipelineRun already exists for the same commit. This prevents duplicate runs when repository owners repeatedly test the same commit by `/test` and `/retest` command.

If you have multiple `PipelineRun` and you want to target a specific `PipelineRun`, you can use the `/test` command followed by the specific PipelineRun name to restart it. Example:

```text
Pipeline execution appears to be unstable due to external factors. Retesting this specific pipeline.

/test <pipelinerun-name>
```

Please be aware that GitOps commands such as `/test` and others will not function on closed Pull Requests or Merge Requests.

## GitOps Commands on Pushed Commits

{{< support_matrix github_app="true" github_webhook="true" gitea="false" gitlab="true" bitbucket_cloud="false" bitbucket_server="false" >}}

If you want to trigger a GitOps command on a pushed commit, you can include the `GitOps` comments within your commit messages. These comments can be used to restart either all pipelines or specific ones. Here's how it works:

For restarting all PipelineRuns:

1. Use `/retest` or `/test` within your commit message.

For restarting a specific PipelineRun:
2. Use `/retest <pipelinerun-name>` or `/test <pipelinerun-name>` within your commit message. Replace `<pipelinerun-name>` with the specific name of the PipelineRun you want to restart.

The GitOps command triggers a PipelineRun only on the latest commit (HEAD) of the branch and does not work on older commits.

**Note:**

When executing `GitOps` commands on a commit that exists in multiple branches within a push request, the branch with the latest commit will be used.

This means:

1. When a user comments with commands like `/retest` or `/test` on a branch without specifying a branch name, the test will automatically run on the **default branch** (e.g. main, master) of the repository.

   Examples:

   1. `/retest`
   2. `/test`
   3. `/retest <pipelinerun-name>`
   4. `/test <pipelinerun-name>`

2. If the user includes a branch specification such as `/retest branch:test` or `/test branch:test`, the test will be executed on the commit where the comment is located, with the context of the **test** branch.

   Examples:

   1. `/retest branch:test`
   2. `/test branch:test`
   3. `/retest <pipelinerun-name> branch:test`
   4. `/test <pipelinerun-name> branch:test`

Please note that the `/ok-to-test` command does not work on pushed commits, as it is specifically intended for pull requests to manage authorization. Since only authorized users are allowed to send `GitOps` commands on pushed commits,
there is no need to use the `ok-to-test` command in this context.

For example, when executing a GitOps command like `/test test-pr branch:test` on a pushed commit, verify that the `test-pr` is on the test branch in your repository and includes the `on-event` and `on-target-branch` annotations as demonstrated below:

```yaml
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: "test-pr"
  annotations:
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: "[test]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[push]"
spec:
```

To issue a `GitOps` comment on a pushed commit, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to your repository.
2. Click on the **Commits** section.
3. Choose one of the individual **Commit**.
4. Click on the line number where you want to add a `GitOps` comment, as shown in the image below:

![GitOps Commits For Comments](/images/gitops-comments-on-commit.png)

Please note that this feature is supported for the GitHub provider only.

## GitOps Commands on Non-Matching PipelineRun

The PipelineRun will be restarted regardless of the annotations if the comment `/test <pipelinerun-name>` or `/retest <pipelinerun-name>` is used. This allows you to have control of PipelineRuns that get only triggered by a comment on the Pull Request.

### Triggering PipelineRun on Git tags

{{< support_matrix github_app="true" github_webhook="true" gitea="false" gitlab="false" bitbucket_cloud="false" bitbucket_server="false" >}}

You can retrigger a PipelineRun against a specific Git tag by commenting on
the tagged commit using a GitOps command. Pipelines-as-Code will resolve the
tag to its commit SHA and run the matching PipelineRun against that commit.

Supported commands:

- `/test tag:<tag>`: retrigger all matching PipelineRuns for the tag commit
- `/test <pipelinerun-name> tag:<tag>`: retrigger only the named PipelineRun
- `/retest tag:<tag>`: retrigger all matching PipelineRuns for the tag commit
- `/retest <pipelinerun-name> tag:<tag>`: retrigger only the named PipelineRun
- `/cancel tag:<tag>`: cancel all running PipelineRuns for the tag commit
- `/cancel <pipelinerun-name> tag:<tag>`: cancel only the named PipelineRun

Examples:

```text
/test tag:v1.0.0
```

or

```text
/retest tag:v1.0.0
```

```text
/cancel tag:v1.0.0
```

```text
/cancel pipelinerun-on-tag tag:v1.0.0
```

```text
/test pipelinerun-on-tag tag:v1.0.0
```

Notes:

- The event type is treated as `push`; configure your PipelineRun with
  `pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[push]"`.
- This is currently supported on GitHub (App and Webhook) only.

Minimal PipelineRun example:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: pipelinerun-on-tag
  annotations:
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: "[refs/tags/*]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[push]"
spec:
  pipelineSpec:
    tasks:
      - name: tag-task
        taskSpec:
          steps:
            - name: echo
              image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-micro
              script: |
                echo "tag: {{ git_tag }}"
```

How to comment on a tag commit (GitHub):

1. Go to your repository and open the Tags view (or Releases).
2. Click the tag (for example, `v1.0.0`) to navigate to its commit.
3. Add a comment on the commit with one of the commands above.

## Accessing the Comment Triggering the PipelineRun

When you trigger a PipelineRun via a GitOps Command, the template variable `{{
trigger_comment }}` is set to the actual comment that triggered it.

You can then perform actions based on the comment content with a shell script
or other methods.

Expanding `{{ trigger_comment }}` in YAML can break parsing if the comment
contains newlines. For example, a GitHub comment like:

```console
/help

This is a test.
```

Expands to:

```yaml
params:
  - name: trigger_comment
    value: "/help

This is a test."
```

The empty line makes the YAML invalid. To prevent this, we replace `\r\n` with
`\n` to ensure proper formatting.

You can restore the newlines in your task as needed.

For example, in a shell script, use `echo -e` to expand `\n` back into actual newlines:

```shell
echo -e "{{ trigger_comment }}" > /tmp/comment
grep "/help" /tmp/comment # will output only /help
```

This ensures the comment is correctly formatted when processed.

## Custom GitOps Commands

Using the [on-comment]({{< relref "/docs/guide/matchingevents.md#matching-a-pipelinerun-on-a-regex-in-a-comment" >}}) annotation on your `PipelineRun`, you can define custom GitOps commands that will be triggered by comments on the Pull Request.

See the [on-comment]({{< relref "/docs/guide/matchingevents.md#matching-a-pipelinerun-on-a-regex-in-a-comment" >}}) guide for more detailed information.

The `on-comment` annotation offers a powerful and flexible way to build a
GitOps command system, letting you trigger specific actions based on comments
made on a Pull Request.

For a practical example, check out the related project
[pac-boussole](https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/pac-boussole), which
utilizes the `on-comment` annotation to create a PipelineRun experience similar
to [Prow](https://docs.prow.k8s.io/).

## Cancelling a PipelineRun

You can cancel a running PipelineRun by commenting on the Pull Request.

For example, if you want to cancel all your PipelineRuns, you can add a comment starting with `/cancel`, and all PipelineRuns attached to that Pull Request will be cancelled.

Example:

```text
The infrastructure appears to be experiencing issues. Cancelling the current PipelineRuns.

/cancel
```

If you have multiple `PipelineRun` and you want to target a specific `PipelineRun`, you can use the `/cancel` comment with the PipelineRun name.

Example:

```text
The infrastructure appears to be experiencing issues, cancelling this specific pipeline.

/cancel <pipelinerun-name>
```

In the GitHub App, the status of the Pipeline will be set to `cancelled`.

### Cancelling the PipelineRun on Push Request

You can cancel a running PipelineRun by commenting on the commit. Here's how you can do it.

Example:

1. Use `/cancel` to cancel all PipelineRuns.
2. Use `/cancel <pipelinerun-name>` to cancel a specific PipelineRun.

**Note:**

When executing `GitOps` comments on a commit that exists in multiple branches within a push request, the branch with the latest commit will be used.

This means:

1. If a user specifies commands like `/cancel` without any argument in a comment on a branch, it will automatically target the **main** branch.

   Examples:

   1. `/cancel`
   2. `/cancel <pipelinerun-name>`

2. If the user issues a command like `/cancel branch:test`, it will target the commit where the comment was made but use the **test** branch.

   Examples:

   1. `/cancel branch:test`
   2. `/cancel <pipelinerun-name> branch:test`

In the GitHub App, the status of the Pipeline will be set to `cancelled`.

Please note that this feature is supported for the GitHub provider only.

## Passing Parameters to GitOps Commands as Arguments

{{< tech_preview "Passing parameters to GitOps commands as arguments" >}}

When you issue a GitOps command, you can pass arguments to the command to redefine some of the [standard]({{< relref "/docs/guide/authoringprs#dynamic-variables" >}}) dynamic variables or the [custom parameters]({{< relref "/docs/guide/customparams" >}}).

For example, you can do:

```text
/test pipelinerun1 key=value
```

and the custom parameter `key`, if defined as a custom parameter, will be set to `value`.

If the comment does not start with a `/`, it will not be parsed.

You can only override parameters from the standard or when set as custom parameters; you cannot pass arbitrary parameters that haven't been defined previously.

You can pass those `key=value` pairs anywhere in your comment, and they will be parsed.

There are different formats that can be accepted, allowing you to pass values with spaces or newlines:

- key=value
- key="a value"
- key="another \"value\" defined"
- key="another
  value with newline"

## Event Type Annotation and Dynamic Variables

The `pipeline.tekton.dev/event-type` annotation indicates the type of GitOps command that has triggered the PipelineRun.

Here are the possible event types:

- `test-all-comment`: The event is a single `/test` that would test every matched PipelineRun.
- `test-comment`: The event is a `/test <PipelineRun>` comment that would test a specific PipelineRun.
- `retest-all-comment`: The event is a single `/retest` that would retest every matched **failed** PipelineRun. If a successful PipelineRun already exists for the same commit, no new PipelineRun will be created.
- `retest-comment`: The event is a `/retest <PipelineRun>` that would retest a specific PipelineRun.
- `on-comment`: The event is coming from a custom comment that would trigger a PipelineRun.
- `cancel-all-comment`: The event is a single `/cancel` that would cancel every matched PipelineRun.
- `cancel-comment`: The event is a `/cancel <PipelineRun>` that would cancel a specific PipelineRun.
- `ok-to-test-comment`: The event is a `/ok-to-test` that would allow running the CI for an unauthorized user. If a successful PipelineRun already exists for the same commit, no new PipelineRun will be created.

If a repository owner comments `/ok-to-test` on a pull request from an external contributor but no PipelineRun **matches** the `pull_request` event (or the repository has no `.tekton` directory), Pipelines-as-Code sets a **neutral** commit status. This indicates that no PipelineRun was matched, allowing other workflows—such as auto-merge—to proceed without being blocked.

{{< hint info >}}

Note: This neutral check-run status functionality is only supported on GitHub.

{{< /hint >}}

When using the `{{ event_type }}` [dynamic variable]({{< relref "/docs/guide/authoringprs.md#dynamic-variables" >}}) for the following event types:

- `test-all-comment`
- `test-comment`
- `retest-all-comment`
- `retest-comment`
- `cancel-all-comment`
- `ok-to-test-comment`

The dynamic variable will return `pull_request` as the event type instead of the specific categorized GitOps command type. This is to handle backward compatibility with previous releases for users relying on this dynamic variable.

This currently only issues a warning in the repository matched namespace but will then be deprecated and changed to return the specific event type.
