# Pipelines as Code resolver

If `Pipelines as Code` sees a PipelineRun with a reference to a `Task` or a
`Pipeline` in any YAML file located in the `.tekton/` directory, `Pipelines as
Code` will automatically try to *resolves* it (see below) as a single
PipelineRun with an embedded `PipelineSpec` to a `PipelineRun`.

The resolver will transform the Pipeline `Name` field to a `generateName` based on the
Pipeline name as well. This allows you to have multiple runs in the same namespace from the same
PipelineRun with no risk of conflicts.

Every task or pipeline your PipelineRun references will need to be inside the
`.tekton/` directory or subdirectories or referenced with a remote task (see
below on how the remote tasks are referenced).

The resolver will skip resolving if it sees these type of tasks:

* a reference to a [`ClusterTask`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/tasks.md#task-vs-clustertask)
* a `Task` or `Pipeline` [`Bundle`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/pipelines.md#tekton-bundles)
* a [Custom Task](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/pipelines.md#using-custom-tasks) with an apiVersion that doesn't have a `tekton.dev/` prefix.

It just uses them "as is" and will not try to do anything with it.

If Pipelines as Code cannot resolve the referenced tasks in the `Pipeline` or
`PipelineSpec`, the run will fail before applying the pipelinerun onto the
cluster.

You should be able to see the issue on your Git provider platform or
through the log of the controller.

If you need to test your `PipelineRun` locally before sending it in a PR, you
can use the `resolve` command from the `tkn-pac` CLI See the `--help` of the
command to learn about how to use it.

## Remote Task annotations

`Pipelines as Code` support fetching remote tasks or pipeline from a remote
location with annotations on PipelineRun.

If the resolver sees a PipelineRun referencing a remote task or a Pipeline in
a PipelineRun or a PipelineSpec it will automatically inlines them.

An annotation to a remote task looks like this :

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/task: "git-clone"
```

or multiple tasks with an array :

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/task: "[git-clone, pylint]"
```

The syntax above installs the
[git-clone](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/main/task/git-clone) task
from the [tekton hub](https://hub.tekton.dev) repository querying for the latest
one with the tekton hub API.

You can have multiple tasks in there if you separate them by a comma `,` around
an array syntax with bracket:

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/task: "[git-clone, golang-test, tkn]"
```

You can have multiple lines if you add a `-NUMBER` suffix to the annotation, for
example :

```yaml
  pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/task: "git-clone"
  pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/task-1: "golang-test"
  pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/task-2: "tkn"
```

By default, `Pipelines as Code` will interpret the string as the `latest` task to
grab
from [tekton hub](https://hub.tekton.dev).

If you want to have a specific version of the task, you can add a colon `:` to
the string and a version number, like in
this example :

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/task: "[git-clone:0.1]" # this will install git-clone 0.1 from tekton.hub
```

If you have a string starting with http:// or https://, `Pipelines as Code`
will fetch the task directly from that remote URL :

```yaml
  pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/task: "[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/main/task/git-clone/0.3/git-clone.yaml]"
```

Additionally, you can as well have a reference to a task from a YAML file inside your repo if you specify the relative path to it, for example :

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/task: "[share/tasks/git-clone.yaml]"
```

This will grab the file `share/tasks/git-clone.yaml` from the current
repository on the `SHA` where the event come from (i.e: the current pull
request or the current branch push).

If there is any error fetching those resources, `Pipelines as Code` will error
out and not process the pipeline.

If the object fetched cannot be parsed as a Tekton `Task` it will error out.

## Remote Pipeline annotations

Remote Pipeline can be referenced by annotation, this allows you to share your Pipeline definition across.

Only one Pipeline is allowed in annotation.

An annotation to a remote pipeline looks like this :

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/pipeline: "https://git.provider/raw/pipeline.yaml
```

It supports remote URL and files inside the same Git repository.

[Tekton Hub](https://hub.tekton.dev) doesn't currently have support for `Pipeline`.
