title: Running the PipelineRun
weight: 2

This page explains how Pipelines-as-Code triggers and executes PipelineRuns based on Git events, including permission controls, error handling, and cancellation options.

When an event such as a push or pull request occurs, Pipelines-as-Code matches it against
PipelineRuns in the `.tekton/` directory of your repository
that are annotated with the appropriate event type.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Pipelines-as-Code fetches PipelineRun definitions from the `.tekton` directory at the
root of the repository where the event originates, unless you have
configured the [provenance from the default
branch]({{< relref "/docs/guides/repository-crd/#pipelinerun-definition-provenance" >}}) on your Repository
CR.
{{< /callout >}}

For example, if a PipelineRun has this annotation:

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[pull_request]"
```

Pipelines-as-Code automatically triggers and executes it when a user with appropriate permissions submits a pull request. See [ACL Permissions for triggering PipelineRuns](#acl-permissions-for-triggering-pipelineruns) below.

When you use GitHub as a Git provider, Pipelines-as-Code runs on draft pull requests by default. To prevent pipelines from triggering on draft pull requests, add the following annotation:

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-cel-expression: event == "pull_request" && !body.pull_request.draft
```

With this configuration, the pipeline only triggers when the pull request is converted to "Ready for Review." For additional examples, see [Advanced event matching using CEL]({{< relref "/docs/guides/event-matching/cel-expressions" >}}).

If you use the GitHub App method and have installed it on an organization,
Pipelines-as-Code only triggers when it detects a Repository CR whose URL
matches a repository that belongs to that organization. If no matching
Repository CR exists, Pipelines-as-Code does not trigger.

## ACL Permissions for triggering PipelineRuns

Pipelines-as-Code allows a submitter to run a PipelineRun if any of the following conditions are met:

- The pull request author is the owner of the repository.
- The pull request author is a collaborator on the repository.
- The pull request author is a public or private member of the organization that
  owns the repository.
- The pull request author has push permissions on branches inside the
  repository.
- The pull request author is listed in the `OWNERS` file on the default branch
  (see the [OWNERS file format](#owners-file) below).

If an unauthorized user attempts to trigger a PipelineRun by creating
a pull request or by any other means, Pipelines-as-Code blocks the
execution and posts a `'Pending'` status check. This check informs the user
that they lack the necessary permissions. An authorized user can then start the
PipelineRun by commenting `/ok-to-test` on the pull request.

GitHub bot users, as identified through the GitHub API, are exempt from
the `Pending` status check that would otherwise block a pull request. Pipelines-as-Code
silently ignores the check for bots unless they have been
explicitly authorized (using the [OWNERS](#owners-file) file,
[Policy]({{< relref "/docs/advanced/policy-authorization" >}}), or other means).

## OWNERS file

The `OWNERS` file follows a format similar to the Prow `OWNERS` file
format (detailed at <https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/owners/>). Pipelines-as-Code
supports a basic `OWNERS` configuration with `approvers` and `reviewers` lists,
both of which grant equal permissions for executing a PipelineRun.

If the `OWNERS` file uses `filters` instead of a simple configuration, Pipelines-as-Code only
considers the `.*` filter and extracts the `approvers` and `reviewers` lists from
it. Any other filters targeting specific files or directories are ignored.

Pipelines-as-Code also supports `OWNERS_ALIASES`, which allows you to map alias names to
lists of usernames.

Adding contributors to the `approvers` or `reviewers` lists in your
`OWNERS` file grants them the ability to execute a PipelineRun.

For example, if your repository’s `main` or `master` branch contains the
following `approvers` section:

```yaml
approvers:
  - approved
```

The user with the username `"approved"` will have the necessary
permissions.

## PipelineRun Execution

Pipelines-as-Code always runs the PipelineRun in the namespace of the Repository CR associated with the repository
that generated the event.

You can monitor the execution from the command line with the `tkn pac` [CLI]({{< relref "/docs/cli/installation" >}}):

```console
tkn pac logs -n my-pipeline-ci -L
```

To view a PipelineRun other than the most recent one, run `tkn
pac logs` without the `-L` flag. Pipelines-as-Code prompts you to select a PipelineRun attached to the
repository:

```console
tkn pac logs -n my-pipeline-ci
```

If you have set up Pipelines-as-Code with the [Tekton Dashboard](https://github.com/tektoncd/dashboard/)
or the OpenShift Console,
Pipelines-as-Code posts a URL in the Checks tab for GitHub Apps. You can
click this URL to follow the pipeline execution directly in the dashboard.

## Errors When Parsing PipelineRun YAML

If Pipelines-as-Code encounters an issue with the YAML formatting of Tekton resources in the repository, it posts a comment on
the pull request describing the error. Pipelines-as-Code also logs the error in the namespace event stream and in the controller log.

Despite validation errors, Pipelines-as-Code continues to run other correctly parsed and matched PipelineRuns.
However, a YAML syntax error in any PipelineRun halts the execution of all PipelineRuns, even those that are syntactically correct.

{{< support_matrix github_app="true" github_webhook="true" forgejo="true" gitlab="true" bitbucket_cloud="false" bitbucket_server="false" >}}

When an event triggers from a pull request, Pipelines-as-Code creates a new comment on
the pull request detailing the error.

Subsequent iterations on the pull request update the comment with any new
errors.

If no new errors are detected, the comment remains and is not deleted.

Here is an example of a YAML error reported as a comment on a pull request:

## Cancelling

### Cancelling in-progress PipelineRuns

{{< tech_preview "Cancelling in progress PipelineRuns" >}}
{{< support_matrix github_app="true" github_webhook="true" forgejo="true" gitlab="true" bitbucket_cloud="true" bitbucket_datacenter="false" >}}

You can cancel a PipelineRun that is currently in progress by adding the annotation `pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/cancel-in-progress:
"true"` to the PipelineRun definition. This is useful when a new push to the same branch makes an older run irrelevant.

This feature takes effect only while the PipelineRun is in progress. If the
PipelineRun has already completed or been cancelled, the cancellation has
no effect. To clean up old PipelineRuns, see the [max-keep-run annotation]({{< relref
"/docs/advanced/cleanup" >}}) instead.

The cancellation scope is limited to PipelineRuns within the current
pull request or the targeted branch for push events. For example, if two
pull requests each have a PipelineRun with the same name and the
cancel-in-progress annotation, Pipelines-as-Code only cancels the PipelineRun in the specific pull request. This prevents interference between separate pull requests.

Pipelines-as-Code cancels older PipelineRuns only after it successfully creates and starts the latest PipelineRun. This annotation does not guarantee that only
one PipelineRun is active at a time.

If a PipelineRun is in progress and the pull request is closed or declined,
Pipelines-as-Code cancels the PipelineRun.

Currently, `cancel-in-progress` cannot be used in conjunction with the [concurrency
limit]({{< relref "/docs/guides/repository-crd/concurrency" >}}) setting.

### Cancelling a PipelineRun with a GitOps command

See [here]({{< relref "/docs/guides/gitops-commands/advanced#cancelling-a-pipelinerun" >}})

## Restarting the PipelineRun

You can restart a PipelineRun without sending a new commit to
your branch or pull request.

### GitHub Apps

If you use the GitHub Apps method, go to the "Checks"
tab and click the "Re-Run" button in the upper right corner. Pipelines-as-Code
re-executes the PipelineRun.

You can rerun a specific pipeline or the entire suite of checks.
