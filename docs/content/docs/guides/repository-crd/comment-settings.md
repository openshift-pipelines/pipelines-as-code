This page explains how to control the volume and behavior of Pull/Merge Request comments that Pipelines-as-Code generates for PipelineRun status updates.

For GitHub (Webhook), GitLab, and Gitea/Forgejo integrations, you can control which
Pull/Merge Request comments Pipelines-as-Code posts by using
the `spec.<provider>.comment_strategy` setting. This is useful for reducing notification
volume in repositories that use long-lasting Pull/Merge Requests with many PipelineRuns.

The `spec.<provider>.comment_strategy` field accepts `""`
(default), `"update"`, and `"disable_all"`.

Setting `comment_strategy` to `update` creates a single comment for
each PipelineRun. When the status changes or the PipelineRun is re-executed,
Pipelines-as-Code updates the same comment with the new status and the associated commit SHA.

Setting `comment_strategy` to `disable_all` prevents Pipelines-as-Code
from posting any comment on the Pull/Merge Request related to
PipelineRun status.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
The `update` and `disable_all` strategy applies only to
comments about a PipelineRun's status (e.g., "started," "succeeded").
Pipelines-as-Code may still post comments if there are errors validating PipelineRuns in
the `.tekton/` directory. (See [Running the PipelineRun docs]({{< relref "/docs/guides/running-pipelines#errors-when-parsing-pipelinerun-yaml" >}}) for details.)

## GitLab

By default, Pipelines-as-Code attempts to update the commit status through the
GitLab API. It first tries the source project (fork), then falls back to the
target project (upstream repository). The source project update succeeds when
the configured token has access to the source repository and GitLab creates
pipeline entries for external CI systems like Pipelines-as-Code.

The target project fallback may fail if there is no CI pipeline running for that commit
in the target repository, because GitLab only creates pipeline entries for commits
that actually trigger CI in that specific project. If either status update
succeeds, Pipelines-as-Code does not post a comment on the Merge Request.

When a status update succeeds, you can see the status in the GitLab UI in the `Pipelines` tab, as
shown in the following example:

![Gitlab Pipelines from Pipelines-as-Code](/images/gitlab-pipelines-tab.png)

Pipelines-as-Code posts comments only when:

- Both commit status updates fail (typically due to insufficient token permissions)
- The event type and repository settings allow commenting
- The `comment_strategy` is not set to `disable_all`

```yaml
spec:
  settings:
    gitlab:
      comment_strategy: "disable_all"
```

## GitHub Webhook

```yaml
spec:
  settings:
    github:
      comment_strategy: "disable_all"
```

## Forgejo/Gitea

You can also configure a custom `User-Agent` header for API requests to
Forgejo/Gitea instances. This is useful when your instance is behind an AI
scraping protection proxy (such as [Anubis](https://anubis.techaro.lol/)) that
blocks requests without a recognized `User-Agent`.

By default, Pipelines-as-Code sends `pipelines-as-code/<version>` as the
`User-Agent`. You can override this per repository:

```yaml
spec:
  settings:
    forgejo:
      user_agent: "my-custom-agent"
```
