title: Comment and Label Matching
weight: 2

Beyond branch and event annotations, Pipelines-as-Code can trigger PipelineRuns based on comments or labels on pull requests. This is useful when you want human-initiated actions -- such as typing `/merge-pr` in a comment -- to kick off specific pipelines, or when you want labeling a pull request (for example, with `bug`) to automatically run a targeted test suite.

## Matching on a comment regex

{{< tech_preview "Matching PipelineRun on regex in comments" >}}
{{< support_matrix github_app="true" github_webhook="true" forgejo="true" gitlab="true" bitbucket_cloud="false" bitbucket_datacenter="false" >}}

You can trigger a PipelineRun when someone posts a comment on a pull request or a [pushed commit]({{< relref "/docs/guides/gitops-commands/push-commands">}}) by using the annotation `pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-comment`.

Pipelines-as-Code treats the annotation value as a regular expression (regex). It strips leading and trailing whitespace from the comment before matching, so `^` matches the start of the comment text and `$` matches the end.

Only newly created comments trigger matching. Edits or updates to existing comments do not trigger the PipelineRun.

Example:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: "merge-pr"
  annotations:
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-comment: "^/merge-pr"
```

Pipelines-as-Code triggers the `merge-pr` PipelineRun when a comment on a pull request starts with `/merge-pr`.

When the `on-comment` annotation triggers a PipelineRun, Pipelines-as-Code sets the template variable {{ trigger_comment }}. For details, see [Accessing the comment triggering the PipelineRun]({{< relref "/docs/guides/gitops-commands/advanced#accessing-the-comment-triggering-the-pipelinerun" >}}).

The `on-comment` annotation follows the pull_request [Policy]({{< relref "/docs/advanced/policy-authorization" >}}) rules. Only users listed in the pull_request policy can trigger the PipelineRun.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
The `on-comment` annotation works with pull_request events. For push events, Pipelines-as-Code supports it only [when targeting the main branch without arguments]({{< relref "/docs/guides/gitops-commands/push-commands" >}}).
{{< /callout >}}

## Matching on pull request labels

{{< tech_preview "Matching PipelineRun to a Pull-Request label" >}}
{{< support_matrix github_app="true" github_webhook="true" forgejo="true" gitlab="true" bitbucket_cloud="false" bitbucket_datacenter="false" >}}

You can use the annotation `pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-label` to trigger a PipelineRun when a pull request carries a specific label. For example, to run the PipelineRun `match-bugs-or-defect` whenever a pull request has the label `bug` or `defect`:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: match-bugs-or-defect
  annotations:
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-label: "[bug, defect]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: "[main]"
    pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[pull_request]"
```

* The `on-label` annotation respects the `pull_request` [Policy]({{< relref "/docs/advanced/policy-authorization" >}}) rules.
* You still need `on-target-branch` to specify which branch the pull request targets.
* You still need `on-event` to specify the event type.
* Pipelines-as-Code supports this annotation on GitHub, Forgejo, and GitLab only. Bitbucket Cloud and Bitbucket Data Center do not support pull request labels.
* When you add a label to a pull request, Pipelines-as-Code triggers the matching PipelineRun immediately and does not activate other PipelineRuns that match the same pull request.
* If you push a new commit to the pull request, Pipelines-as-Code triggers the label-matched PipelineRun again as long as the label is still present.
* You can access pull request labels with the [dynamic variable]({{< relref "/docs/guides/creating-pipelines#dynamic-variables" >}}) `{{ pull_request_labels }}`. Labels are separated by a Unix newline `\n`. For example, you can print them in a shell script:

  ```bash
   for i in $(echo -e "{{ pull_request_labels }}");do
   echo $i
   done
  ```

## Escaping commas in branch names

If a branch name contains a comma, use the HTML escape entity `&#44;` in place of the literal comma. For example, to match both `main` and a branch named `release,nightly`:

```yaml
pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: [main, release&#44;nightly]
```
