# Use Pipelines-as-Code with Bitbucket Cloud

Pipelines-As-Code supports on [Bitbucket Cloud](https://bitbucket.org) through a webhook.

Follow the Pipelines-As-Code [installation](/docs/install/installation) according to your Kubernetes cluster.

## Create Bitbucket Cloud App Password

Follow this guide to create an app password:

<https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/>

Check these boxes to add the permissions to the token:

- Account: `Email`, `Read`
- Workspace membership: `Read`, `Write`
- Projects: `Read`, `Write`
- Issues: `Read`, `Write`
- Pull requests: `Read`, `Write`

**NOTE:** If you are going to configure webhook through CLI, you must also add additional permission

- Webhooks: `Read and write`

{{< hint info >}}
[Refer to this screenshot](/images/bitbucket-cloud-create-secrete.png) to verify you have properly configured the app password.
{{< /hint >}}

Keep the generated token noted somewhere, or otherwise you will have to recreate it.

## Create a `Repository` and configure webhook

There are two ways to create the `Repository` and configure the webhook:

### Create a `Repository` and configure webhook using the `tkn pac` tool

- Use the [`tkn pac create repo`](/docs/guide/cli) command to
configure a webhook and create the `Repository` CR.

  You need to have a App Password created. `tkn pac` will use this token to configure the webhook, and add it in a secret
in the cluster which will be used by Pipelines-As-Code controller for accessing the `Repository`.

Below is the sample format for `tkn pac create repo`

```shell script
$ tkn pac create repo

? Enter the Git repository url (default: https://bitbucket.org/workspace/repo):  
? Please enter the namespace where the pipeline should run (default: repo-pipelines): 
! Namespace repo-pipelines is not found
? Would you like me to create the namespace repo-pipelines? Yes
✓ Repository workspace-repo has been created in repo-pipelines namespace
✓ Setting up Bitbucket Webhook for Repository https://bitbucket.org/workspace/repo
? Please enter your bitbucket cloud username:  <username>
ℹ ️You now need to create a Bitbucket Cloud app password, please checkout the docs at https://is.gd/fqMHiJ for the required permissions
? Please enter the Bitbucket Cloud app password:  ************************************
👀 I have detected a controller url: https://pipelines-as-code-controller-openshift-pipelines.apps.awscl2.aws.ospqa.com
? Do you want me to use it? Yes
✓ Webhook has been created on repository workspace/repo
🔑 Webhook Secret workspace-repo has been created in the repo-pipelines namespace.
🔑 Repository CR workspace-repo has been updated with webhook secret in the repo-pipelines namespace
ℹ Directory .tekton has been created.
✓ A basic template has been created in /home/Go/src/bitbucket/repo/.tekton/pipelinerun.yaml, feel free to customize it.
ℹ You can test your pipeline by pushing generated template to your git repository

```

### Create a `Repository` and configure webhook manually

- From the left navigation pane of your Bitbucket Cloud repository, go to **Repository settings** -->
  **Webhooks** tab and click on the **Add webhook** button.

  - Set a **Title** (i.e: Pipelines-as-Code)

  - Set the **URL** to Pipelines-as-Code controller public URL. On OpenShift, you can get the public URL of the Pipelines-as-Code
  controller like this:

    ```shell
    echo https://$(oc get route -n pipelines-as-code pipelines-as-code-controller -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
    ```

  - The individual events to select are :
    - Repository -> Push
    - Pull Request -> Created
    - Pull Request -> Updated
    - Pull Request -> Comment created

    {{< hint info >}}
    [Refer to this screenshot](/images/bitbucket-cloud-create-webhook.png) to verify you have properly configured the webhook.
    {{< /hint >}}

  - Click on **Save**.

- You can now create a [`Repository CRD`](/docs/guide/repositorycrd).
  It will have:

  - A **Username** (i.e: your Bitbucket username).
  - A reference to a Kubernetes **Secret** containing the App Password as generated previously for Pipelines-as-Code operations.

- Create the secret with the app password in the `target-namespace`:

  ```shell
  kubectl -n target-namespace create secret generic bitbucket-cloud-token \
          --from-literal provider.token="APP_PASSWORD_AS_GENERATED_PREVIOUSLY"
  ```

- Create the `Repository` CRD with the secret field referencing it. For example:

```yaml
  ---
  apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
  kind: Repository
  metadata:
    name: my-repo
    namespace: target-namespace
  spec:
    url: "https://bitbucket.com/workspace/repo"
    branch: "main"
    git_provider:
      user: "yourbitbucketusername"
      secret:
        name: "bitbucket-cloud-token"
        # Set this if you have a different key in your secret
        # key: “provider.token“
```

## Bitbucket Cloud Notes

- The `git_provider.secret` key cannot reference to a secret in another namespace.
  Pipelines as code always assumes that it will be in the same namespace where the
  `Repository` has been created.

- The `tkn pac create` and `tkn pac bootstrap` commands are not supported on Bitbucket Server.

{{< hint info >}}
You can only reference a user by the `ACCOUNT_ID` in a owner file. For reason see here:

<https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/bitbucket-api-changes-gdpr/#introducing-atlassian-account-id-and-nicknames>
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint danger >}}

- There is no webhook secret support in Bitbucket Cloud. To secure
  the payload and prevent hijacking of the CI, Pipelines-as-Code will fetch the
  IP addresses list from <https://ip-ranges.atlassian.com/> and ensure that the
  webhook receptions come only from the Bitbucket Cloud IPs.
- If you want to add some IP addresses or networks, you can add them to the
  `bitbucket-cloud-additional-source-ip` key in the pipelines-as-code
  `ConfigMap` in the `pipelines-as-code` namespace. You can add multiple
  network or IPs separated by a comma.

- If you want to disable this behavior you can set the
  `bitbucket-cloud-check-source-ip` key to `false` in the pipelines-as-code
  `ConfigMap` in the `pipelines-as-code` namespace.
{{< /hint >}}

## Add webhook secret

- For an existing `Repository`, if webhook secret has been deleted (or you want to add a new webhook to project settings) for Bitbucket Cloud,
  use `tkn pac webhook add` command to add a webhook to project repository settings, as well as update the `webhook.secret`
  key in the existing `Secret` object without updating `Repository`.

Below is the sample format for `tkn pac webhook add`

```shell script
$ tkn pac webhook add -n repo-pipelines

✓ Setting up Bitbucket Webhook for Repository https://bitbucket.org/workspace/repo
? Please enter your bitbucket cloud username:  <username>
👀 I have detected a controller url: https://pipelines-as-code-controller-openshift-pipelines.apps.awscl2.aws.ospqa.com
? Do you want me to use it? Yes
✓ Webhook has been created on repository workspace/repo
🔑 Secret workspace-repo has been updated with webhook secert in the repo-pipelines namespace.

```

**Note:** If `Repository` exist in a namespace other than the `default` namespace, use `tkn pac webhook add [-n namespace]`.
  In the above example, `Repository` exist in the `repo-pipelines` namespace rather than the `default` namespace; therefore
  the webhook was added in the `repo-pipelines` namespace.

## Update token

There are two ways to update the provider token for the existing `Repository`:

### Update using tkn pac cli

- Use the [`tkn pac webhook update-token`](/docs/guide/cli) command which
  will update provider token for the existing `Repository` CR.

Below is the sample format for `tkn pac webhook update-token`

```shell script
$ tkn pac webhook update-token -n repo-pipelines

? Please enter your personal access token:  ************************************
🔑 Secret workspace-repo has been updated with new personal access token in the repo-pipelines namespace.

```

**NOTE:** If `Repository` exist in a namespace other than the `default` namespace, use `tkn pac webhook update-token [-n namespace]`.
  In the above example, `Repository` exist in the `repo-pipelines` namespace rather than the `default` namespace; therefore
  the webhook token updated in the `repo-pipelines` namespace.

### Update by changing `Repository` YAML or using `kubectl patch` command

When you have regenerated an app password, you must update it in the cluster.
For example, you can replace `$password` and `$target_namespace` with their respective values:

You can find the secret name in the `Repository` CR.

  ```yaml
  spec:
    git_provider:
      secret:
        name: "bitbucket-cloud-token"
  ```

```shell
kubectl -n $target_namespace patch secret bitbucket-cloud-token -p "{\"data\": {\"provider.token\": \"$(echo -n $password|base64 -w0)\"}}"
```
