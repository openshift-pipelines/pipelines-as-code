# Getting started with Pipelines-as-Code

This guide will walk you through the process of getting started with Pipelines-as-Code.

This will start with the installation of Pipelines-as-Code on your cluster, then
the creation of a GitHub Application, the creation of a Repository CR to specify
which repository you want to use with Pipelines-as-Code, olnd finally we are
going to create a simple Pull Request to test that configuration and see how the
Pipelines-as-Code flow looks like.

## Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster like [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/), or [OpenShift Local](<https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview>)
* The OpenShift Pipelines Operator installed or [Tekton Pipelines](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/install/) installed on your cluster
* The [Tekton CLI](https://tekton.dev/docs/cli/#installation) installed, and the Pipelines-as-Code CLI plugin ([tkn-pac](https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/guide/cli/#install)) installed

## Installing Pipelines-as-Code

There are multiple ways to install Pipelines-as-Code. The easiest way is to have it managed by the OpenShift Pipelines Operator, which installs Pipelines-as-Code by default.

You can also install it manually by applying the YAML files to your cluster or use `tkn pac bootstrap` to do it for you.

The `tkn pac bootstrap` command allows you to get started quickly and try out Pipelines-as-Code. If you are running this in production, you should consider installing Pipelines-as-Code using a GitOps tool like [OpenShift GitOps](https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/gitops/) or [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) following the manual installation instructions.

Let's get started with `tkn pac bootstrap`:

### Pipelines-as-Code Installation

```bash
% tkn pac bootstrap
=> Checking if Pipelines-as-Code is installed.
üïµÔ∏è Pipelines-as-Code doesn't seem to be installed in the pipelines-as-code namespace.
? Do you want me to install Pipelines-as-Code v0.19.2? (Y/n) 
```

As soon as you get started, it will try to detect if you have Pipelines-as-Code installed. If it isn't installed, you will be asked if you want to install it.

You can go ahead and press `Y` to install it.

### Webhook Forwarder

The second question asks if you want to install the tool called [gosmee](https://github.com/chmouel/gosmee). This will only be asked if you are not running on OpenShift. This is not required, but since we need a way to have GitHub reach the Pipelines-as-Code controller from the internet, it's the easiest way to do it.

```console
Pipelines-as-Code does not install an Ingress object to allow the controller to be accessed from the internet. 
We can install a webhook forwarder called gosmee (https://github.com/chmouel/gosmee) using a https://hook.pipelinesascode.com URL. 
This will let your git platform provider (e.g., GitHub) reach the controller without requiring public access.
? Do you want me to install the gosmee forwarder? (Y/n) 
üí° Your gosmee forward URL has been generated: https://hook.pipelinesascode.com/zZVuUUOkCzPD
```

### Tekton Dashboard

Another question is only asked if you are not running on OpenShift. It will
detect if you have the [Tekton Dashboard](https://github.com/tekton/dashboard)
installed and if you want to use it for the links to show the logs or
description of the PipelineRun.

```console
üëÄ We have detected a tekton dashboard install on http://dashboard.paac-127-0-0-1.nip.io
? Do you want me to use it? Yes
```

## GitHub Application

The next step is to create a GitHub Application. You don't necessarily need to
use Pipelines-as-Code with a GitHub Application (you can use it with a simple
webhook as well), but it's the method that will give you the best experience.

You first need to enter the name of the GitHub Application you want to
create. This name must be unique, so try to choose a name that is not too
obvious and won't conflict with existing applications.

```console
? Enter the name of your GitHub application: My PAAC Application
```

As soon as you press Enter, the CLI will try to launch your web browser with the
URL <https://localhost:8080>, which will display a button to create the GitHub
Application. When you click the button, you will be redirected to GitHub and see
the following screen:

![GitHub Application Creation](/images/github-app-creation-screen.png)

If you are satisfied with the name, you can click the "Create GitHub App" button. Then, you can return to your terminal where `tkn pac bootstrap` was launched. You will see that the GitHub Application has been created and a secret token has been generated.

```console
üîë Secret pipelines-as-code-secret has been created in the pipelines-as-code namespace
üöÄ You can now add your newly created application to your repository by going to this URL:

https://github.com/apps/my-paac-application

üí° Don't forget to run "tkn pac create repository" to create a new Repository CR on your cluster.
```

You can visit the your newly created GitHub Application by clicking on the URL,
by clicking on the `App settings` button you can inspect how the GitHub
Application has been created. The `tkn pac bootstrap` command will have
configured everything you need to get started with Pipelines-as-Code, but you
can customize advanced settings in there if necessary.

{{< hint info >}}
A useful tab to look at is the "Advanced" tab, this is where you can see all the recent deliveries of the GitHub app toward the Pipelines-as-Code controller. This is useful to debug if you have any issues with the communication between GitHub and the endpoint URL, or to investigate which events are being sent.
{{< /hint >}}

### Creating a GitHub Repository

As mentioned at the end of the `tkn pac bootstrap` command, you need to create a Repository CR to specify which repository you want to use with Pipelines-as-Code.

If you don't have a repository, you can easily create one using this template:

<https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/pac-demo/generate>

Choose your username (e.g., `chmouel` for me) and a repository name (e.g., `pac-demo`), then click the "Create repository from template" button.

{{< hint info >}}
Pipelines-as-Code also works well with [private repositories]({{< relref "/docs/guide/privaterepo.md" >}}), but let's keep it simple for now and create a public repository.
{{< /hint >}}

Your repository is now created on GitHub at <https://github.com/yourusername/pac-demo>.

### Install the GitHub Application in our Repository

Next, you need to add the GitHub Application you created to this repository. You can do that by following these steps:

1. Go to the GitHub App URL provided by `tkn pac bootstrap`, for example: [https://github.com/apps/my-paac-application](https://github.com/apps/my-paac-application).
2. Click on the "Install" button.
3. Choose the repository you just created under your username.

Here is an example of what it looks like for me:

![GitHub Application Installation](/images/github-app-install-application-on-repo.png)

### Check-out the newly created repository

Let's go back to the terminal and check-out the newly created repository
with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/$yourusername/pac-demo
cd pac-demo
```

We navigate inside our repository since `tkn pac` will use the Git information
to provide some hepful defaults with the subsequent commands we will execute.

## Create a Repository CR

{{< hint info >}}
A Repository CR is how you configure Pipelines-as-Code. It's a Kubernetes object that is not part of the core Kubernetes API. It's a way to extend Kubernetes with new objects. In this case, we are using a CR to specify which Repository URL (among other [settings]({{< relref "/docs/guide/repositorycrd.md" >}})) we want to use with Pipelines-as-Code and the namespace location where our PipelineRuns will be run.
{{< /hint >}}

You are now ready to create a Repository CR with the command:

```bash
tkn pac create repository
```

The command try to be smart and helpful, and as soon you are launching it will have
detected the git information of the current repository and will ask you if you
want to use those values.

```console
? Enter the Git repository url (default: https://github.com/chmouel/pac-demo):
```

You probably want to press enter here to use the default value, and then it will ask you to which namespace you will want to have your CI running. Again you can choose the default value here:

```console
? Please enter the namespace where the pipeline should run (default: pac-demo-pipelines):
! Namespace pac-demo-pipelines is not found
? Would you like me to create the namespace pac-demo-pipelines? (Y/n)
```

When this is done the process will be over it will generate a `Repository` CR in your cluster and create a directory called `.tekton` with a file named `pipelinerun.yaml` in it.

```console
‚Ñπ Directory .tekton has been created.
‚úì We have detected your repository using the programming language Go.
‚úì A basic template has been created in /tmp/pac-demo/.tekton/pipelinerun.yaml, feel free to customize it.
‚Ñπ You can test your pipeline by pushing generated template to your git repository
```

Note that the command detected that you are using Go and created a basic template for you and had customized for the Go language (ie: it will add the [golangci-lint](https://hub.tekton.dev/tekton/task/golangci-lint) task to your PipelineRun).

Feel free to open the file `.tekton/pipelinerun.yaml` and customize it to your liking. The file has plenty of comments to help you get started.

## Creating a Pull Request

Now that we have our Repository CR created in our namespace our `.tekton/pipelinerun.yaml` generated we are now able to test if Pipelines-as-Code works.

Let's first create a branch to create a Pull Request from that branch.

```bash
git checkout -b tektonci
```

Let's commit the `.tekton/pipelinerun.yaml` file and push it to our repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Adding Tekton CI`
git push origin tektonci
```

{{< hint info >}}
We assume you have already set-up your system to be able to push to GitHub. If that's not the case see the official GitHub documentation on how to do it: <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git>
{{< /hint >}}

When the branch is pushed you can start creating a new Pull Request by going to the URL <https://github.com/yourusername/pac-demo/pull/new/tektonci>

As soon as you create the Pull Request you will see that the Pipelines-as-Code has been triggered:

![GitHub Application Installation](/images/github-app-install-CI-triggered.png)

You can click on the "Details" link to see the details of the running of the PipelineRun. `Pipelines-as-Code` will let you know that you can follow the logs on your Dashboard like [Tekton Dashboard](https://github.com/tekton/dashboard) or the OpenShift Pipelines [Console](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/web_console/web-console.html) or if you prefer you can use [tekton CLI](https://tekton.dev/docs/cli/) to follow the PipelineRun execution on your cluster.

When the PipelineRun is finished you will see an error on that Detail screen:

![GitHub Application Installation](/images/github-app-install-CI-failed.png)

That was on purpose, we have detected some error on the Go code and GolangCI lint that is not correct. See how the error displayed link to the line of the code that is wrong. Pipelines-as-Code analyze the log error of the PipelineRun and try to match it to the line of the code that is wrong so you can easily fix it.

![GitHub Application Installation](/images/github-app-matching-annotations.png)

### Fixing the error and pushing again

Let's go ahead and go back to our terminal and fix that error. Edit the file `main.go` select everything and  replace it with this content

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "Hello world")
}
```

commit this file and push it to your branch:

```bash
git commit -a -m "Errare humanum est, ignoscere divinum."
git push origin tektonci
```

If you go back to your web browser you will see that the PipelineRun has been triggered again and this time it has succeeded:

![GitHub Application Installation](/images/github-app-install-CI-succeeded.png)

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have now successfully setup Pipelines-as-Code for running
Continuous Integration on your repository. Now, you can freely proceed to
[customize]({{< relref "/docs/guide/authoringprs.md" >}}) your `.tekton/pipelinerun.yaml` file as per your preferences and
include additional tasks as needed.
