This page covers how to configure Pipelines-as-Code with Bitbucket Cloud through a webhook. Use this method to run Tekton pipelines triggered by pull requests and push events on repositories hosted on bitbucket.org.

## Prerequisites

- A running Pipelines-as-Code [installation]({{< relref "/docs/installation/installation" >}})
- A Bitbucket Cloud API token or App Password (see below)
- The public URL of your Pipelines-as-Code controller route or ingress endpoint

## Create a Bitbucket API Token

Follow [this guide](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/create-an-api-token/) to create an API token.

Check these boxes to add the permissions to the token:

- **read:workspace:bitbucket**
- **read:pullrequest:bitbucket**
- **read:repository:bitbucket**
- **write:repository:bitbucket**

Store the generated token in a safe place, or you will have to recreate it.

## Webhook Configuration using the CLI

Use the [`tkn pac create repo`]({{< relref "/docs/cli" >}}) command to
configure a webhook and create the Repository CR in one step.

You need an App Password created. `tkn pac` uses this token to configure the webhook and stores it in a secret
in the cluster, which the Pipelines-as-Code controller uses for accessing the repository.

Below is the sample format for `tkn pac create repo`

```shell script
$ tkn pac create repo

? Enter the Git repository url (default: https://bitbucket.org/workspace/repo):
? Please enter the namespace where the pipeline should run (default: repo-pipelines):
! Namespace repo-pipelines is not found
? Would you like me to create the namespace repo-pipelines? Yes
✓ Repository workspace-repo has been created in repo-pipelines namespace
✓ Setting up Bitbucket Webhook for Repository https://bitbucket.org/workspace/repo
? Please enter your bitbucket cloud username:  <username>
ℹ ️You now need to create a Bitbucket Cloud app password, please checkout the docs at https://is.gd/fqMHiJ for the required permissions
? Please enter the Bitbucket Cloud app password:  ************************************
👀 I have detected a controller url: https://pipelines-as-code-controller-openshift-pipelines.apps.awscl2.aws.ospqa.com
? Do you want me to use it? Yes
✓ Webhook has been created on repository workspace/repo
🔑 Webhook Secret workspace-repo has been created in the repo-pipelines namespace.
🔑 Repository CR workspace-repo has been updated with webhook secret in the repo-pipelines namespace
ℹ Directory .tekton has been created.
✓ A basic template has been created in /home/Go/src/bitbucket/repo/.tekton/pipelinerun.yaml, feel free to customize it.
ℹ You can test your pipeline by pushing the generated template to your git repository

```

## Webhook Configuration (Manual)

If you prefer to configure the webhook yourself, follow these steps.

- From the left navigation pane of your Bitbucket Cloud repository, go to **Repository settings** -->
  **Webhooks** tab and click on the **Add webhook** button.

  - Set a **Title** (i.e: Pipelines-as-Code)

  - Set the **URL** to the Pipelines-as-Code controller public URL. On OpenShift, get the public URL of the Pipelines-as-Code
  controller like this:

    ```shell
    echo https://$(oc get route -n pipelines-as-code pipelines-as-code-controller -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
    ```

  - The individual events to select are:
    - Repository -> Push
    - Repository -> Updated
    - Repository -> Commit comment created
    - Pull Request -> Created
    - Pull Request -> Updated
    - Pull Request -> Merged
    - Pull Request -> Declined
    - Pull Request -> Comment created
    - Pull Request -> Comment updated

[Refer to this screenshot](/images/bitbucket-cloud-create-webhook.png) to verify you have properly configured the webhook.

- Click on **Save**.

### Create the Secret

Create a Kubernetes secret containing your App Password in the `target-namespace` (the namespace where your pipeline CI runs):

```shell
kubectl -n target-namespace create secret generic bitbucket-cloud-token \
        --from-literal provider.token="APP_PASSWORD_AS_GENERATED_PREVIOUSLY"
```

### Create the Repository CR

Create a [`Repository` CR]({{< relref "/docs/guides/repository-crd" >}}) with the secret field referencing it:

```yaml
  ---
  apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
  kind: Repository
  metadata:
    name: my-repo
    namespace: target-namespace
  spec:
    url: "https://bitbucket.com/workspace/repo"
    git_provider:
      user: "your_atlassian_email_id"
      secret:
        name: "bitbucket-cloud-token"
        # Set this if you have a different key in your secret
        # key: "provider.token"
```

You must use your Bitbucket/Atlassian account email address in the `user` field of the Repository CR. To find your email address, click on your profile icon at the top-left corner in the Bitbucket Cloud UI (see image below), go to **Account Settings**, and scroll down to locate your email address.

## Notes

- The `git_provider.secret` key cannot reference a secret in another namespace.
  Pipelines-as-Code always assumes it is in the same namespace where the
  Repository CR has been created.

- The `tkn pac create` and `tkn pac bootstrap` commands are not supported on Bitbucket Cloud.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
You can only reference a user by the `ACCOUNT_ID` in a owner file. For reason see here:

<https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/bitbucket-api-changes-gdpr/#introducing-atlassian-account-id-and-nicknames>
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="error" >}}

- There is no webhook secret support in Bitbucket Cloud. To secure
  the payload and prevent hijacking of the CI, Pipelines-as-Code will fetch the
  IP addresses list from <https://ip-ranges.atlassian.com/> and ensure that the
  webhook receptions come only from the Bitbucket Cloud IPs.
- If you want to add some IP addresses or networks, you can add them to the
  `bitbucket-cloud-additional-source-ip` key in the pipelines-as-code
  `ConfigMap` in the `pipelines-as-code` namespace. You can add multiple
  network or IPs separated by a comma.

- If you want to disable this behavior you can set the
  `bitbucket-cloud-check-source-ip` key to `false` in the pipelines-as-code
  `ConfigMap` in the `pipelines-as-code` namespace.

## Add Webhook Secret

If the webhook secret for an existing Repository CR has been deleted, or you want to add a new webhook to your project settings, use the `tkn pac webhook add` command. This command adds a webhook to the project repository settings and updates the `webhook.secret` key in the existing secret without modifying the Repository CR.

Below is the sample format for `tkn pac webhook add`

```shell script
$ tkn pac webhook add -n repo-pipelines

✓ Setting up Bitbucket Webhook for Repository https://bitbucket.org/workspace/repo
? Please enter your bitbucket cloud username:  <username>
👀 I have detected a controller url: https://pipelines-as-code-controller-openshift-pipelines.apps.awscl2.aws.ospqa.com
? Do you want me to use it? Yes
✓ Webhook has been created on repository workspace/repo
🔑 Secret workspace-repo has been updated with webhook secret in the repo-pipelines namespace.

```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
If the `Repository` exists in a namespace other than the `default` namespace, use `tkn pac webhook add [-n namespace]`.
In the above example, the `Repository` exists in the `repo-pipelines` namespace rather than the `default` namespace, so the webhook was added in the `repo-pipelines` namespace.
{{< /callout >}}

## Update Token

There are two ways to update the provider token for an existing Repository CR.

### Update using the CLI

Use the [`tkn pac webhook update-token`]({{< relref "/docs/cli" >}}) command to
update the provider token for an existing Repository CR.

Below is the sample format for `tkn pac webhook update-token`

```shell script
$ tkn pac webhook update-token -n repo-pipelines

? Please enter your personal access token:  ************************************
🔑 Secret workspace-repo has been updated with new personal access token in the repo-pipelines namespace.

```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
If the `Repository` exists in a namespace other than the `default` namespace, use `tkn pac webhook update-token [-n namespace]`.
In the above example, the `Repository` exists in the `repo-pipelines` namespace rather than the `default` namespace, so the webhook token was updated in the `repo-pipelines` namespace.
{{< /callout >}}

### Update using kubectl

When you have regenerated an app password, you must update it in the cluster. You can find the secret name in the Repository CR:

  ```yaml
  spec:
    git_provider:
      secret:
        name: "bitbucket-cloud-token"
  ```

Replace `$password` and `$target_namespace` with your values:

```shell
kubectl -n $target_namespace patch secret bitbucket-cloud-token -p "{\"data\": {\"provider.token\": \"$(echo -n $password|base64 -w0)\"}}"
```
