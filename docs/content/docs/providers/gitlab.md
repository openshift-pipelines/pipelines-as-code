This page covers how to configure Pipelines-as-Code with GitLab through a webhook. Use this method to run Tekton pipelines triggered by merge requests and push events on GitLab repositories, including self-managed GitLab instances.

## Prerequisites

- A running Pipelines-as-Code [installation]({{< relref "/docs/installation/installation" >}})
- A GitLab personal access token with `api` scope (see below)
- The public URL of your Pipelines-as-Code controller route or ingress endpoint

## Create a GitLab Personal Access Token

Follow this guide to generate a personal token as the manager of the organization or the project:

<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html>

{{< callout type="info" >}}
You can create a token scoped only to the project. Since the
token needs `api` access to the forked repository from where
the MR originates, a project-scoped token will fail for fork-based workflows. Pipelines-as-Code falls back to showing the pipeline status as a comment
on the Merge Request.
{{< /callout >}}

Store the generated token in a safe place, or you will have to recreate it.

## Webhook Configuration using the CLI

Use the [`tkn pac create repo`]({{< relref "/docs/cli" >}}) command to
configure a webhook and create the Repository CR in one step.

You need a personal access token created with the `api` scope. `tkn pac` uses this token to configure the webhook and stores it in a secret in the cluster, which the Pipelines-as-Code controller uses for accessing the repository.

Below is the sample format for `tkn pac create repo`:

```shell script
$ tkn pac create repo

? Enter the Git repository url (default: https://gitlab.com/repositories/project):
? Please enter the namespace where the pipeline should run (default: project-pipelines):
! Namespace project-pipelines is not found
? Would you like me to create the namespace project-pipelines? Yes
✓ Repository repositories-project has been created in project-pipelines namespace
✓ Setting up GitLab Webhook for Repository https://gitlab.com/repositories/project
? Please enter the project ID for the repository you want to be configured,
  project ID refers to an unique ID (e.g. 34405323) shown at the top of your GitLab project : 17103
👀 I have detected a controller url: https://pipelines-as-code-controller-openshift-pipelines.apps.awscl2.aws.ospqa.com
? Do you want me to use it? Yes
? Please enter the secret to configure the webhook for payload validation (default: lFjHIEcaGFlF):  lFjHIEcaGFlF
ℹ️ You now need to create a GitLab personal access token with `api` scope
ℹ️ Go to this URL to generate one https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens, see https://is.gd/rOEo9B for documentation
? Please enter the GitLab access token:  **************************
? Please enter your GitLab API URL:  https://gitlab.com
✓ Webhook has been created on your repository
🔑 Webhook Secret repositories-project has been created in the project-pipelines namespace.
🔑 Repository CR repositories-project has been updated with webhook secret in the project-pipelines namespace
ℹ Directory .tekton has been created.
✓ A basic template has been created in /home/Go/src/gitlab.com/repositories/project/.tekton/pipelinerun.yaml, feel free to customize it.
ℹ You can test your pipeline by pushing the generated template to your git repository
```

## Webhook Configuration (Manual)

If you prefer to configure the webhook yourself, follow these steps.

- From your GitLab project, go to **Settings** --> **Webhooks**.

  - Set the **URL** to the Pipelines-as-Code controller public URL. On OpenShift, get the public URL of the
  Pipelines-as-Code controller like this:

    ```shell
    echo https://$(oc get route -n pipelines-as-code pipelines-as-code-controller -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
    ```

  - Add a secret or generate a random one with this command:

    ```shell
    head -c 30 /dev/random | base64
    ```

  - [Refer to this screenshot](/images/gitlab-add-webhook.png) on how to configure the Webhook.

    The individual events to select are:

    - Merge request Events
    - Push Events
    - Comments
    - Tag push events

  - Click on **Add webhook**

### Create the Secret

Create a Kubernetes secret containing your personal token and the webhook secret in the `target-namespace` (the namespace where your pipeline CI runs):

```shell
kubectl -n target-namespace create secret generic gitlab-webhook-config \
  --from-literal provider.token="TOKEN_AS_GENERATED_PREVIOUSLY" \
  --from-literal webhook.secret="SECRET_AS_SET_IN_WEBHOOK_CONFIGURATION"
```

### Create the Repository CR

Create a [`Repository` CR]({{< relref "/docs/guides/repository-crd" >}}) with the secret field referencing it:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: my-repo
  namespace: target-namespace
spec:
  url: "https://gitlab.com/group/project"
  git_provider:
    # url: "https://gitlab.example.com/ # Set this if you are using a private GitLab instance
    type: "gitlab"
    secret:
      name: "gitlab-webhook-config"
      # Set this if you have a different key in your secret
      # key: "provider.token"
    webhook_secret:
      name: "gitlab-webhook-config"
      # Set this if you have a different key in your secret
      # key: "webhook.secret"
```

## Notes

- Pipelines-as-Code does not automatically detect private GitLab instances, so you must specify the API URL under `spec.git_provider.url`.

- The `git_provider.secret` key cannot reference a secret in another namespace. Pipelines-as-Code always assumes that it is in the same namespace where the Repository CR has been created.

## Working with Forked Repositories

When your token scope affects how Pipelines-as-Code can report pipeline status on merge requests from forks, the following considerations apply.

### Token Scoping for Fork-based Workflows

- **Project-scoped tokens**: Limited to the upstream repository, cannot access forks. Status reporting falls back to merge request comments. This is the most secure option but has limited functionality.

- **Organization/Group-scoped tokens**: Can access multiple repositories including forks. Enables status checks on both the fork and upstream. Requires broader permissions.

- **Bot account tokens**: Recommended for production (see troubleshooting section below). Provides minimal required permissions and a clear audit trail.

### Status Reporting Fallback

Pipelines-as-Code supports merge requests from forked repositories with an automatic fallback mechanism for status reporting:

1. **Primary**: Pipelines-as-Code attempts to set commit status on the fork (source project). If successful, the status appears in both the fork and upstream UI. This requires a token with write access to the fork repository.

2. **Fallback**: Pipelines-as-Code attempts to set commit status on the upstream (target project). The status appears in the upstream repository UI. This may fail if the upstream has no active CI pipeline for the commit.

3. **Final Fallback**: Pipelines-as-Code posts the status as a merge request comment. This always works as long as the token has merge request write permissions. The comment provides the same information as status checks in a different format.

This design ensures status reporting works even with restricted token permissions.

**Visual Example:**

Status checks appear in GitLab's "Pipelines" tab:
![GitLab Pipelines Tab](/images/gitlab-pipelines-tab.png)

When status check reporting is unavailable, comments provide the same information
(Comments show pipeline status, duration, and results).

### Troubleshooting Fork Merge Requests

#### Why does my fork merge request show comments instead of status checks?

**Symptom:** Pipeline status appears as merge request comments, not in the "Pipelines" tab.

**Root Cause:** The GitLab token configured in your Repository CR lacks write access
to the fork repository.

**What Happened:**

1. PaC attempted to set status on fork → Failed (insufficient permissions)
2. PaC attempted to set status on upstream → Failed (no CI pipeline on upstream for this commit)
3. PaC fell back to MR comment → Succeeded ✓

**This is working as designed.** Comments provide the same pipeline information as
status checks, just in a different format.

#### How can I get status checks instead of comments?

Choose the option that fits your security model:

##### Option 1: Bot Account (Recommended for Production)

Create a dedicated service account with minimal permissions:

1. Create GitLab bot/service account
2. Grant permissions:
   - Read access: upstream and fork repositories
   - Write access: fork repository (for status updates)
   - CI pipeline access: upstream repository
3. Generate personal access token with `api` scope for bot account
4. Use bot token in Repository CR secret

**Advantages:**

- Minimal permissions principle
- Clear audit trail (pipeline actions attributed to bot)
- No personal token rotation when team members change

**Trade-off:** Requires GitLab account administration

##### Option 2: Group-scoped Token

Use a [Group Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html) with `api` scope. This token will have access to all repositories within the group:

**Advantages:**

- Simple to set up
- Works for both fork and upstream

**Trade-offs:**

- Broader permission scope
- Personal token tied to individual user account

##### Option 3: Accept Comment-based Status (Default)

Continue using project-scoped token with comment fallback:

**Advantages:**

- Most restrictive permissions
- No additional configuration needed

**Trade-off:** Status appears as comments instead of checks

#### Can I disable status comments entirely?

Yes. If you prefer not to see status comments on your merge requests, you can disable them by updating your Repository CR:

```yaml
spec:
  settings:
    gitlab:
      comment_strategy: "disable_all"
```

See [Repository CR documentation]({{< relref "/docs/guides/repository-crd/comment-settings" >}})
for details.

**Important:** Even with correct token permissions, upstream status updates may fail
if GitLab doesn't create a pipeline entry for that commit in the upstream repository.
GitLab only creates pipeline entries when CI actually runs in that project.

#### Can I use forks for development within a single repository?

Yes. The restrictions only apply to cross-repository merge requests (fork to upstream).

If you are working within a single repository (even a fork used as your primary repo):

- Token needs `api` scope for that repository
- Status checks appear normally
- No permission issues expected

#### Where can I learn more about the fallback mechanism?

See the detailed technical explanation and visual example in:
[Repository CR - GitLab comment strategy]({{< relref "/docs/guides/repository-crd/comment-settings#gitlab" >}})

## Add Webhook Secret

If the webhook secret for an existing Repository CR has been deleted, or you want to add a new webhook to your project settings, use the `tkn pac webhook add` command. This command adds a webhook to the project repository settings and updates the `webhook.secret` key in the existing secret without modifying the Repository CR.

Below is the sample format for `tkn pac webhook add`:

```shell script
$ tkn pac webhook add -n project-pipelines

✓ Setting up GitLab Webhook for Repository https://gitlab.com/repositories/project
? Please enter the project ID for the repository you want to be configured,
  project ID refers to an unique ID (e.g. 34405323) shown at the top of your GitLab project : 17103
👀 I have detected a controller url: https://pipelines-as-code-controller-openshift-pipelines.apps.awscl2.aws.ospqa.com
? Do you want me to use it? Yes
? Please enter the secret to configure the webhook for payload validation (default: TXArbGNDHTXU):  TXArbGNDHTXU
✓ Webhook has been created on your repository
🔑 Secret repositories-project has been updated with webhook secret in the project-pipelines namespace.

```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
If the `Repository` exists in a namespace other than the `default` namespace, use `tkn pac webhook add [-n namespace]`.
In the above example, the `Repository` exists in the `project-pipelines` namespace rather than the `default` namespace, so the webhook was added in the `project-pipelines` namespace.
{{< /callout >}}

## Update Token

There are two ways to update the provider token for an existing Repository CR.

### Update using the CLI

Use the [`tkn pac webhook update-token`]({{< relref "/docs/cli" >}}) command to
update the provider token for an existing Repository CR.

Below is the sample format for `tkn pac webhook update-token`:

```shell script
$ tkn pac webhook update-token -n repo-pipelines

? Please enter your personal access token:  **************************
🔑 Secret repositories-project has been updated with new personal access token in the project-pipelines namespace.
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
If the `Repository` exists in a namespace other than the `default` namespace, use `tkn pac webhook update-token [-n namespace]`.
In the above example, the `Repository` exists in the `project-pipelines` namespace rather than the `default` namespace, so the webhook token was updated in the `project-pipelines` namespace.
{{< /callout >}}

### Update using kubectl

When you have regenerated a new token, you must update it in the cluster. You can find the secret name in the Repository CR:

  ```yaml
  spec:
    git_provider:
      # url: "https://gitlab.example.com/ # Set this if you are using a private GitLab instance
      secret:
        name: "gitlab-webhook-config"
  ```

Replace `$NEW_TOKEN` and `$target_namespace` with your values:

```shell
kubectl -n $target_namespace patch secret gitlab-webhook-config -p "{\"data\": {\"provider.token\": \"$(echo -n $NEW_TOKEN|base64 -w0)\"}}"
```
