This page covers how to configure Pipelines-as-Code with [Bitbucket Data Center](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/enterprise). Use this method when your organization runs a self-hosted Bitbucket Server or Data Center instance.

## Prerequisites

- A running Pipelines-as-Code [installation]({{< relref "/docs/installation/installation" >}})
- A Bitbucket Data Center personal access token with `PROJECT_ADMIN` and `REPOSITORY_ADMIN` permissions (see below)
- The public URL of your Pipelines-as-Code controller route or ingress endpoint

## Create a Bitbucket Personal Access Token

Generate a personal access token as the manager of the project by following the steps here:

<https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/personal-access-tokens-939515499.html>

The token needs the `PROJECT_ADMIN` and `REPOSITORY_ADMIN` permissions. It also needs access to forked repositories in pull requests, otherwise Pipelines-as-Code cannot process and access the pull request.

{{< callout type="info" >}}

The service account user that owns the token must be a **licensed Bitbucket
user** (i.e., granted the `LICENSED_USER` global permission) for group-based
permission checks to work. If the service account is an unlicensed technical
user, group membership cannot be resolved and users with group-only access
will not be able to trigger builds. As a workaround, add those users
individually to the project or repository permissions.

{{< /callout >}}

Store the generated token in a safe place, or you will have to recreate it.

## Webhook Configuration (Manual)

Pipelines-as-Code does not support `tkn pac create repo` or `tkn pac bootstrap` for Bitbucket Data Center. You must configure the webhook manually.

Create a webhook on the repository following this guide:

<https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/manage-webhooks/>

- Add a secret or generate a random one with:

```shell
  head -c 30 /dev/random | base64
```

- Set the payload URL to the Pipelines-as-Code public URL. On OpenShift, get the
  public URL of the Pipelines-as-Code route like this:

  ```shell
  echo https://$(oc get route -n pipelines-as-code pipelines-as-code-controller -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
  ```

- [Refer to this screenshot](/images/bitbucket-datacenter-create-webhook.png) for
  which events to select on the webhook. The individual events to select are:

  - Repository -> Push
  - Repository -> Modified
  - Pull Request -> Opened
  - Pull Request -> Source branch updated
  - Pull Request -> Comments added

### Create the Secret

Create a Kubernetes secret containing your personal token and the webhook secret in the `target-namespace` (the namespace where your pipeline CI runs):

```shell
kubectl -n target-namespace create secret generic bitbucket-datacenter-webhook-config \
  --from-literal provider.token="TOKEN_AS_GENERATED_PREVIOUSLY" \
  --from-literal webhook.secret="SECRET_AS_SET_IN_WEBHOOK_CONFIGURATION"
```

### Create the Repository CR

Create a [`Repository` CR]({{< relref "/docs/guides/repository-crd" >}}) with the secret field referencing it:

```yaml
  ---
  apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
  kind: Repository
  metadata:
    name: my-repo
    namespace: target-namespace
  spec:
    url: "https://bitbucket.com/workspace/repo"
    git_provider:
      # make sure you have the right bitbucket data center api url without the
      # The base URL of your Bitbucket Data Center instance. Do not include the /rest suffix.
      url: "https://bitbucket.datacenter.api.url"
      user: "your-bitbucket-username"
      secret:
        name: "bitbucket-datacenter-webhook-config"
        # Set this if you have a different key in your secret
        # key: "provider.token"
      webhook_secret:
        name: "bitbucket-datacenter-webhook-config"
        # Set this if you have a different key for your secret
        # key: "webhook.secret"
```

## Notes

- The `git_provider.secret` key cannot reference a secret in another namespace. Pipelines-as-Code always assumes it is in the same namespace where the Repository CR has been created.

- The `tkn pac create` and `tkn pac bootstrap` commands are not supported on Bitbucket Data Center.

{{< callout type="error" >}}

- You can only reference a user by the `ACCOUNT_ID` in the owner file.

{{< /callout >}}
