This page covers how to configure Pipelines-as-Code with a GitHub webhook. Use this method when you cannot create a GitHub App, for example in environments where App installation is restricted.

Because a webhook integration does not use the [GitHub CheckRun API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-checks-api), Pipelines-as-Code reports task status as a comment on the pull request instead of through the **Checks** tab. GitOps comments such as `/retest` and `/ok-to-test` are also not supported. To restart CI, create a new commit:

```console
git commit --amend -a --no-edit && git push --force-with-lease origin branchname
```

## Prerequisites

- A running Pipelines-as-Code [installation]({{< relref "/docs/installation/installation" >}})
- A GitHub personal access token (see below)
- The public URL of your Pipelines-as-Code controller route or ingress endpoint

## Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

You need a personal access token so that Pipelines-as-Code can interact with the GitHub API. Follow this guide to create one:

<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token>

### [Fine-grained token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)

If you want to generate a fine-grained token (which is more secure), you can
scope your token to the repository you want tested.

The permissions needed are:

| Name            | Access         |
|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| Administration  | Read Only      |
| Metadata        | Read Only      |
| Content         | Read Only      |
| Commit statuses | Read and Write |
| Pull request    | Read and Write |
| Webhooks        | Read and Write |

### [Classic Tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)

The required scopes depend on your repository visibility.

For public repositories:

- `public_repo` scope

For private repositories:

- The whole `repo` scope

You can click directly on this link to prefill the permissions needed:
<https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=pipelines-as-code-token&scopes=repo>
{{< /callout >}}

Store the generated token in a safe place, or you will have to recreate it.

For best security practice, use a short token expiration (such as the default 30 days). GitHub sends a notification email when your token is about to expire. Follow [Update Token](#update-token) to replace an expired token with a new one.

If you are going to configure a webhook through the CLI, you must also add the scope `admin:repo_hook`.
{{< /callout >}}

## Webhook Configuration using the CLI

Use the [`tkn pac create repo`]({{< relref "/docs/cli" >}}) command to
configure a webhook and create the Repository CR in one step.

You need a personal access token created with the `admin:repo_hook` scope. `tkn pac` uses this token to configure the webhook and stores it in a secret in the cluster, which the Pipelines-as-Code controller uses for accessing the repository. After configuring the webhook, you can update the token in the secret with just the scopes mentioned [above](#create-a-github-personal-access-token).

Below is the sample format for `tkn pac create repo`

```shell script
$ tkn pac create repo

? Enter the Git repository url (default: https://github.com/owner/repo):
? Please enter the namespace where the pipeline should run (default: repo-pipelines):
! Namespace repo-pipelines is not found
? Would you like me to create the namespace repo-pipelines? Yes
✓ Repository owner-repo has been created in repo-pipelines namespace
✓ Setting up GitHub Webhook for Repository https://github.com/owner/repo
👀 I have detected a controller url: https://pipelines-as-code-controller-openshift-pipelines.apps.awscl2.aws.ospqa.com
? Do you want me to use it? Yes
? Please enter the secret to configure the webhook for payload validation (default: sJNwdmTifHTs):  sJNwdmTifHTs
ℹ️ You now need to create a GitHub personal access token; please check the docs at https://is.gd/KJ1dDH for the required scopes
? Please enter the GitHub access token:  ****************************************
✓ Webhook has been created on repository owner/repo
🔑 Webhook Secret owner-repo has been created in the repo-pipelines namespace.
🔑 Repository CR owner-repo has been updated with webhook secret in the repo-pipelines namespace
ℹ Directory .tekton has been created.
✓ We have detected your repository using the programming language Go.
✓ A basic template has been created in /home/Go/src/github.com/owner/repo/.tekton/pipelinerun.yaml, feel free to customize it.
ℹ You can test your pipeline by pushing the generated template to your git repository

```

## Webhook Configuration (Manual)

If you prefer to configure the webhook yourself, follow these steps.

- Go to your repository or organization **Settings** --> **Webhooks** and click on the **Add webhook** button.

  - Set the **Payload URL** to the Pipelines-as-Code controller public URL. On OpenShift, get the public URL of the Pipelines-as-Code controller like this:

    ```shell
    echo https://$(oc get route -n pipelines-as-code pipelines-as-code-controller -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
    ```

  - Choose Content type as **application/json**

  - Add a webhook secret or generate a random one with this command (store it for later use):

    ```shell
    head -c 30 /dev/random | base64
    ```

  - Click "Let me select individual events" and select these events:
    - Commit comments
    - Issue comments
    - Pull request
    - Pushes

    [Refer to this screenshot](/images/pac-direct-webhook-create.png) to verify you have properly configured the webhook.

  - Click on **Add webhook**

### Create the Secret

Create a Kubernetes secret containing your personal token and the webhook secret in the `target-namespace` (the namespace where your pipeline CI runs):

```shell
kubectl -n target-namespace create secret generic github-webhook-config \
  --from-literal provider.token="TOKEN_AS_GENERATED_PREVIOUSLY" \
  --from-literal webhook.secret="SECRET_AS_SET_IN_WEBHOOK_CONFIGURATION"
```

### Create the Repository CR

Create a [`Repository` CR]({{< relref "/docs/guides/repository-crd" >}}) that references the secret:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: my-repo
  namespace: target-namespace
spec:
  url: "https://github.com/owner/repo"
  git_provider:
    secret:
      name: "github-webhook-config"
      # Set this if you have a different key in your secret
      # key: "provider.token"
    webhook_secret:
      name: "github-webhook-config"
      # Set this if you have a different key for your secret
      # key: "webhook.secret"
```

## Notes

- Pipelines-as-Code always assumes that the secret is in the same namespace where the Repository CR has been created.

## Add Webhook Secret

If the webhook secret for an existing Repository CR has been deleted, or you want to add a new webhook to your project settings, use the `tkn pac webhook add` command. This command adds a webhook to the project repository settings and updates the `webhook.secret` key in the existing secret without modifying the Repository CR.

Below is the sample format for `tkn pac webhook add`:

```shell script
$ tkn pac webhook add -n repo-pipelines

✓ Setting up GitHub Webhook for Repository https://github.com/owner/repo
👀 I have detected a controller url: https://pipelines-as-code-controller-openshift-pipelines.apps.awscl2.aws.ospqa.com
? Do you want me to use it? Yes
? Please enter the secret to configure the webhook for payload validation (default: AeHdHTJVfAeH):  AeHdHTJVfAeH
✓ Webhook has been created on repository owner/repo
🔑 Secret owner-repo has been updated with webhook secret in the repo-pipelines namespace.

```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
If the `Repository` exists in a namespace other than the `default` namespace, use `tkn pac webhook add [-n namespace]`.
In the above example, the `Repository` exists in the `repo-pipelines` namespace rather than the `default` namespace, so the webhook was added in the `repo-pipelines` namespace.
{{< /callout >}}

## Update Token

There are two ways to update the provider token for an existing Repository CR.

### Update using the CLI

Use the [`tkn pac webhook update-token`]({{< relref "/docs/cli" >}}) command to
update the provider token for an existing Repository CR.

Below is the sample format for `tkn pac webhook update-token`:

```shell script
$ tkn pac webhook update-token -n repo-pipelines

? Please enter your personal access token:  ****************************************
🔑 Secret owner-repo has been updated with new personal access token in the repo-pipelines namespace.

```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
If the `Repository` exists in a namespace other than the `default` namespace, use `tkn pac webhook update-token [-n namespace]`.
In the above example, the `Repository` exists in the `repo-pipelines` namespace rather than the `default` namespace, so the webhook token was updated in the `repo-pipelines` namespace.
{{< /callout >}}

### Update using kubectl

When you have regenerated a new token, you must update it in the cluster. You can find the secret name in the Repository CR:

  ```yaml
  spec:
    git_provider:
      secret:
        name: "github-webhook-config"
  ```

Replace `$NEW_TOKEN` and `$target_namespace` with your values:

```shell
kubectl -n $target_namespace patch secret github-webhook-config -p "{\"data\": {\"provider.token\": \"$(echo -n $NEW_TOKEN|base64 -w0)\"}}"
```
