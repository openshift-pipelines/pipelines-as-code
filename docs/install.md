# Installation Guides

Pipelines-as-Code support different installation method to Git provider
platforms (i.e: GitHub, Bitbucket etc..)

The preferred method to use Pipelines-as-Code is with
[GitHub Application](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps).

Refers to the end of Documentation for the other provider installations

## Install Pipelines-as-Code as GitHub Application

In order to install and use Pipelines-as-Code as GitHub application, you need to

* Install the Pipelines-as-Code infrastructure on your cluster
* Create a Pipelines-as-Code GitHub App on your GitHub account or organization
* Configure Pipelines-as-Code on your cluster to access the GitHub App

Here is a video describing the install process :

[![Pipelines as Code Install Walkthough](https://img.youtube.com/vi/d81rIHNFjJM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d81rIHNFjJM)

### Install Pipelines as Code infrastructure

To install Pipelines as Code on your cluster you simply need to run this command
:

```shell
VERSION=0.5.2
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/release-$VERSION/release-$VERSION.yaml
```

If you would like to install the current development version you can simply
install it like this :

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/nightly/release.yaml
```

It will apply the release.yaml to your kubernetes cluster, creating the admin
namespace `pipelines-as-code`, the roles and all other bits needed.

The `pipelines-as-code` namespace is where the Pipelines-as-Code infrastructure
runs and is supposed to be accessible only by the admins.

The Route for the EventListener URL is automatically created when you apply the
release.yaml. You will need to grab the url for the next section when creating
the GitHub App. You can run this command to get the route created on your
cluster:

```shell
echo https://$(oc get route -n pipelines-as-code el-pipelines-as-code-interceptor -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```

### RBAC

Non `system:admin` users needs to be allowed explicitly to create repositories
CRD in their namespace

To allow them you need to create a `RoleBinding` on the namespace to the
`openshift-pipeline-as-code-clusterrole`.

For example assuming we want `user` being able to create repository CRD in the
namespace `user-ci`, if we use the openshift `oc` cli :

```shell
oc adm policy add-role-to-user openshift-pipeline-as-code-clusterrole user -n user-ci
```

or via kubectl applying this yaml :

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: openshift-pipeline-as-code-clusterrole
  namespace: user-ci
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: openshift-pipeline-as-code-clusterrole
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: user
```

### Create a Pipelines-as-Code GitHub App

You should now create a Pipelines-as-Code GitHub App which acts as the
integration point with OpenShift Pipelines and brings the Git workflow into
Tekton pipelines. You need the webhook of the GitHub App pointing to your
Pipelines-as-Code EventListener route endpoint which would then trigger
pipelines on GitHub events.

* Go to <https://github.com/settings/apps> (or *Settings > Developer settings > GitHub Apps*) and click on **New GitHub
  App** button
* Provide the following info in the GitHub App form
  * **GitHub Application Name**: `OpenShift Pipelines`
  * **Homepage URL**: *[OpenShift Console URL]*
  * **Webhook URL**: *[the EventListener route URL copies in the previous section]*
  * **Webhook secret**: *[an arbitrary secret, you can generate one with `openssl rand -hex 20`]*

* Select the following repository permissions:
  * **Checks**: `Read & Write`
  * **Contents**: `Read & Write`
  * **Issues**: `Read & Write`
  * **Metadata**: `Readonly`
  * **Pull request**: `Read & Write`

* Select the following organization permissions:
  * **Members**: `Readonly`
  * **Plan**: `Readonly`

* Select the following user permissions:
  * Commit comment
  * Issue comment
  * Pull request
  * Pull request review
  * Pull request review comment
  * Push

> You can see a screenshot of how the GitHub App permissions look like [here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98980/124132813-7e53f580-da81-11eb-9eb4-e4f1487cf7a0.png)

* Click on **Create GitHub App**.

* Take note of the **App ID** at the top of the page on the details page of the GitHub App you just created.

* In **Private keys** section, click on **Generate Private key* to generate a private key for the GitHub app. It will
  download automatically. Store the private key in a safe place as you need it in the next section and in future when
  reconfiguring this app to use a different cluster.

### Configure Pipelines-as-Code on your cluster to access the GitHub App

In order for Pipelines-as-Code to be able to authenticate to the GitHub App and have the GitHub App securely trigger the
Pipelines-as-Code webhook, you need to create a Kubernetes secret containing the private key of the GitHub App and the
webhook secret of the Pipelines-as-Code as it was provided when you created the GitHub App in the previous section. This
secret
is [used to generate](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps)
a token on behalf of the user running the event and make sure to validate the webhook via the webhook secret.

Run the following command and replace:

* `APP_ID` with the GitHub App **App ID** copied in the previous section
* `WEBHOOK_SECRET` with the webhook secret provided when created the GitHub App in the previous section
* `PATH_PRIVATE_KEY` with the path to the private key that was downloaded in the previous section

```bash
kubectl -n pipelines-as-code create secret generic pipelines-as-code-secret \
        --from-literal github-private-key="$(cat PATH_PRIVATE_KEY)" \
        --from-literal github-application-id="APP_ID" \
        --from-literal webhook.secret="WEBHOOK_SECRET"
```

### GitHub Enterprise

Pipelines as Code supports Github Enterprise.

You don't need to do anything special to get Pipelines as code working with GHE. Pipelines as code will automatically
detects the header as set from GHE and use it the GHE API auth url instead of the public github.

## Install Pipelines-as-Code as a GitHub Webhook

If you are not able to create a GitHub application you can install Pipelines-as-Code on your repository as a
[GitHub Webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/creating-webhooks).

Using Pipelines as Code via Github webhook does not give you access to the GitHub CheckRun API, therefore the status of
the tasks will be added as a Comment of the PR and not via the **Checks** Tab.

* You have to first install the Pipelines-as-Code infrastructure as detailed
  here : [Install infrastructure](install.md#install-pipelines-as-code-infrastructure)

* You will have to generate a personal token for Pipelines-as-Code Github API operations. Follow this guide to create a
  personal token :

<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token>

The only permission needed is the *repo* permission. Make sure you note somewhere the generated token or otherwise you
will have to recreate it.

* Go to you repository or organization setting and click on *Hooks* and *"Add webhook"* links.

* Set the payload URL to the event listener public URL. On OpenShift you can get the public URL of the
  Pipelines-as-Code eventlistener like this :

  ```shell
  echo https://$(oc get route -n pipelines-as-code el-pipelines-as-code-interceptor -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
  ```

* Add a secret or generate a random one with this command  :

  ```shell
  openssl rand -hex 20
  ```

* [Refer to this screenshot](./images/pac-direct-webhook-create.png) on how to configure the Webhook. The individual
  events to select are :
  * Commit comments
  * Issue comments
  * Pull request reviews
  * Pull request
  * Pushes

* On your cluster you need create the webhook secret as generated previously in the *pipelines-as-code* namespace.

```shell
kubectl -n pipelines-as-code create secret generic pipelines-as-code-secret \
        --from-literal webhook.secret="$WEBHOOK_SECRET_AS_GENERATED"
```

* You are now able to create a Repository CRD. The repository CRD will have a Secret that contains the Personal token as
  generated and Pipelines as Code will know how to use it for GitHub API operations.

  * First create the secret with the personal token in the `target-namespace` :

  ```shell
  kubectl -n target-namespace create secret generic github-personal-token \
          --from-literal token="TOKEN_AS_GENERATED_PREVIOUSLY"
  ```

  * And now create Repository CRD with the secret field referencing it.

  Here is an example of a Repository CRD :

```yaml
---
apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: my-repo
  namespace: target-namespace
spec:
  url: "https://github.com/owner/repo"
  git_provider:
    url: "https://github.enterprise.com"
    secret:
      name: "github-personal-token"
      # Set this if you have a different key in your secret
      # key: "token"
```

* Note that `git_provider.secret` cannot reference a secret in another
  namespace, Pipelines as code assumes always it will be the same namespace as
  where the repository has been created.

## Install Pipelines-As-Code for Bitbucket Server

Pipelines-As-Code has a full support of [Bitbucket
Server](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/enterprise).

* You have to first install the Pipelines-as-Code infrastructure as detailed
  here : [Install infrastructure](install.md#install-pipelines-as-code-infrastructure)

* You will have to generate a personal token as the manager of the Project,
  follow the steps here :

<https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/personal-access-tokens-939515499.html>

The token will need to have the `PROJECT_ADMIN` and `REPOSITORY_ADMIN` permissions.

Note that the token needs to be able to have access to the forked repository in
pull requests or it would not be able to process and access the pull request.

Make sure you note somewhere the generated token or otherwise you will have to
recreate it.

* Create a Webhook on the repository following this guide :

<https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/manage-webhooks/>

* Add a Secret or generate a random one with :

```shell
  openssl rand -hex 20
```

* Set the URL to the event listener public URL. On OpenShift you can get the
  public URL of the Pipelines-as-Code eventlistener like this :

  ```shell
  echo https://$(oc get route -n pipelines-as-code el-pipelines-as-code-interceptor -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
  ```

* Install the secret in the pipelines-as-code namespace (we currently only
supports one webhook secret per cluster ) :

```shell
kubectl -n pipelines-as-code create secret generic pipelines-as-code-secret \
        --from-literal webhook.secret="$WEBHOOK_SECRET_AS_GENERATED"
```

* [Refer to this screenshot](./images/bitbucket-server-create-webhook.png) on
  which events to handle on the Webhook. The individual events to select are :

  * Repository -> Push
  * Repository -> Modified
  * Pull Request -> Opened
  * Pull Request -> Source branch updated
  * Pull Request -> Comments added

* And finally create Repository CRD with the secret field referencing it.

  * Here is an example of a Repository CRD :

```yaml
---
apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: my-repo
  namespace: target-namespace
spec:
  url: "https://bitbucket.com/workspace/repo"
  git_provider:
    url: "https://bitbucket.server.api.url"
    user: "yourbitbucketusername"
    secret:
      name: "bitbucket-server-token"
      # Set this if you have a different key in your secret
      # key: "token"
```

### Notes

* `git_provider.secret` cannot reference a secret in another namespace,
  Pipelines as code assumes always it will be the same namespace as where the
  repository has been created.

* `tkn-pac create` and `bootstrap` is not supported on Bitbucket Server.

* You can only reference user by the `ACCOUNT_ID` in owner file.

## Install Pipelines-As-Code for Bitbucket Cloud

Pipelines-As-Code has a full support on Bitbucket Cloud on
<https://bitbucket.org>

* You have to first install the Pipelines-as-Code infrastructure as detailed
  here : [Install
  infrastructure](install.md#install-pipelines-as-code-infrastructure)

* You will have to generate an app password for Pipelines-as-Code Bitbucket API
  operations. Follow this guide to create an app password :

<https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/>

Make sure you note somewhere the generated token or otherwise you will have to
recreate it.

* Go to you **"Repository setting"** tab on your **Repository** and click on the
  **WebHooks** tab and **"Add webhook"** button.

* Set a **Title** (i.e: Pipelines as Code)

* Set the URL to the event listener public URL. On OpenShift you can get the public URL of the Pipelines-as-Code
  eventlistener like this :

  ```shell
  echo https://$(oc get route -n pipelines-as-code el-pipelines-as-code-interceptor -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
  ```

* [Refer to this screenshot](./images/bitbucket-cloud-create-webhook.png) on how to configure the Webhook. The
  individual events to select are :
  * Repository -> Push
  * Pull Request -> Created
  * Pull Request -> Updated
  * Pull Request -> Comment created
  * Pull Request -> Comment updated

* You are now able to create a Repository CRD. The repository CRD will have a Secret and Username that contains the App
  Password as generated and Pipelines as Code will know how to use it for Bitbucket API operations.

  * First create the secret with the app password in the `target-namespace` :

  ```shell
  kubectl -n target-namespace create secret generic bitbucket-app-password \
          --from-literal token="TOKEN_AS_GENERATED_PREVIOUSLY"
  ```

  * And now create Repository CRD with the secret field referencing it.

  * Here is an example of a Repository CRD :

```yaml
---
apiVersion: "pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/v1alpha1"
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: my-repo
  namespace: target-namespace
spec:
  url: "https://bitbucket.com/workspace/repo"
  branch: "main"
  git_provider:
    user: "yourbitbucketusername"
    secret:
      name: "bitbucket-cloud-token"
      # Set this if you have a different key in your secret
      # key: "token"
```

### Bitbucket Cloud Notes

* `git_provider.secret` cannot reference a secret in another namespace,
  Pipelines as code assumes always it will be the same namespace as where the
  repository has been created.

* `tkn-pac create` and `bootstrap` is not supported on Bitbucket Server.

* There is no Webhook secret support in Bitbucket Cloud. To be able to secure
  the payload and not let a user hijack the CI, Pipelines-as-Code will fetch the
  ip addresses list from <https://ip-ranges.atlassian.com/> and make sure the
  webhook only comes from the Bitbucket Cloud IPS.
* If you want to add some ips address or networks you can add them to the
  key **bitbucket-cloud-additional-source-ip** in the pipelines-as-code
  configmap in the pipelines-as-code namespace.  You can added multiple
  network or ips separated by a comma.

* If you want to disable this behavior you can set the key
  **bitbucket-cloud-check-source-ip** to false in the pipelines-as-code
  configmap in the pipelines-as-code namespace.

* You can only reference user by `ACCOUNT_ID` in owner file, see here for the
  reasoning :

<https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/bitbucket-api-changes-gdpr/#introducing-atlassian-account-id-and-nicknames>

## Pipelines-As-Code configuration settings

There is a few things you can configure via the configmap `pipelines-as-code` in
the `pipelines-as-code` namespace.

* `application-name`

  The name of the application showing for example in the GitHub Checks
  labels. Default to `"Pipelines as Code CI"`

* `max-keep-days`

  The number of the day to keep the PipelineRuns runs in the `pipelines-as-code`
  namespace. We install by default a cronjob that cleans up the PipelineRuns
  generated on events in pipelines-as-code namespace. Note that these
  PipelineRuns are internal to Pipelines-as-code are separate from the
  PipelineRuns that exist in the user's GitHub repository. The cronjob runs
  every hour and by default cleanups PipelineRuns over a day. This configmap
  setting doesn't affect the cleanups of the user's PipelineRuns which are
  controlled by the [annotations on the PipelineRun definition in the user's
  GitHub repository](#pipelineruns-cleanups).

* `secret-auto-create`

  Whether to auto create a secret with the token generated via the Github
  application to be used with private repositories. This feature is enabled by
  default.

* `remote-tasks`

  Let allows remote tasks from pipelinerun annotations. This feature is enabled by
  default.

* `hub-url`

  The base url for the [tekton hub](https://github.com/tektoncd/hub/)
  API. default to the [public hub](https://hub.tekton.dev/):

  <https://api.hub.tekton.dev/v1>

## Kubernetes

Pipelines as Code should work directly on kubernetes/minikube/kind. You just need to install the release.yaml
for [pipeline](https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/latest/release.yaml)
, [triggers](https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/triggers/latest/release.yaml) and
its [interceptors](https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/triggers/latest/interceptors.yaml) on your cluster.
The release yaml to install pipelines are for the released version :

```shell
VERSION=0.5.2
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/release-$VERSION/release-$VERSION.k8s.yaml
```

and for the nightly :

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/release-$VERSION/release.k8s.yaml
```

If you have [Tekton Dashboard](https://github.com/tektoncd/dashboard). You can
just add the key `tekton-dashboard-url` in the `pipelines-as-code` configmap
set to the full url of the `Ingress` host to get tekton dashboard logs url.

## CLI

`Pipelines as Code` provide a CLI which is designed to work as tkn plugin. To
install the plugin follow the instruction from the [CLI](./cli.md)
documentation.
