# Submitter Checklist

- [ ] ♽  Run `make test lint` before submitting a PR (ie: via [pre-push github hook](../hack/dev/prep-push-hook) no need to waste CPU cycle on CI 
- [ ] 📖 If you are adding a user facing feature or make a change of the behaviour, please make sure to document it
- [ ] 🧪 100% coverage is not a target but most of the time we would rather have a unit test if you make a code change.
- [ ] 🎁 If that's something that is possible to do please make sure to check if we can add a e2e test.
- [ ] 🔎 If there is a flakyness in the CI tests then make sure to get the flakyness fixed before merging or if that's not possible there is a good reason to bypass it.
