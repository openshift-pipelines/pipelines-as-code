## ✅ Submitter Checklist

- [ ] 📝 My commit messages are clear, informative, and follow the project's [How to write a git commit message guide](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/contribute/get-started/commits). **The [Gitlint](https://jorisroovers.com/gitlint/latest) linter ensures in CI it's properly validated**
- [ ] ✨ I have ensured my commit message prefix (e.g., `fix:`, `feat:`) matches the "Type of Change" I selected above.
- [ ] ♽ I have run `make test` and `make lint` locally to check for and fix any
      issues. For an efficient workflow, I have considered installing
      [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and running `pre-commit install` to
      automate these checks.
- [ ] 📖 I have added or updated documentation for any user-facing changes.
- [ ] 🧪 I have added sufficient unit tests for my code changes.
- [ ] 🎁 I have added end-to-end tests where feasible. See [README](https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/blob/main/test/README.md) for more details.
- [ ] 🔎 I have addressed any CI test flakiness or provided a clear reason to bypass it.
- [ ] If adding a provider feature, I have filled in the following and updated the provider documentation:
  - [ ] GitHub App

  - [ ] GitLab
  - [ ] Bitbucket Cloud
