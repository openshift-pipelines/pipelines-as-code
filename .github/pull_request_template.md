# Submitter Checklist

- [ ] 📝 Ensure your commit message is clear and informative. Refer to the How to write a git commit message guide. Include the commit message in the PR body rather than linking to an external site (e.g., Jira ticket).

- [ ] ♽ Run make test lint before submitting a PR to avoid unnecessary CI processing. Consider installing [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and running pre-commit install in the repository root for an efficient workflow.

- [ ] ✨ We use linters to maintain clean and consistent code. Run make lint before submitting a PR. Some linters offer a --fix mode, executable with make fix-linters (ensure [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) and [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) are installed).

- [ ] 📖 Document any user-facing features or changes in behavior.

- [ ] 🧪 While 100% coverage isn't required, we encourage unit tests for code changes where possible.

- [ ] 🎁 If feasible, add an end-to-end test. See [README](https://github.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/blob/main/test/README.md) for details.

- [ ] 🔎 Address any CI test flakiness before merging, or provide a valid reason to bypass it (e.g., token rate limitations).

- If adding a provider feature, fill in the following details:

  - [ ] GitHub App
  - [ ] GitHub Webhook
  - [ ] Gitea/Forgejo
  - [ ] GitLab
  - [ ] Bitbucket Cloud
  - [ ] Bitbucket Data Center

  (update the provider documentation accordingly)
